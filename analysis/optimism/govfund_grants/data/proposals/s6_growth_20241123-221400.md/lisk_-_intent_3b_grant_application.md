# Project Details

# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Specify the goals and objectives of the grants program, such as increasing TVL, launching new protocols, or attracting new users from specific categories

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We understand that we need to abide by the Collective Grant Policies, and that as an OP Chain receiving a grant we must: (1) make grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** Lisk Proposal for Stablecoin Adoption [Season 6 Intent #3B] Summary Lisk is dedicated to accelerating the onboarding of the next billion users to Web3 by focusing on real-world applications in emerging markets. Our proposal aims to support and enhance the stablecoin ecosystem within the Optimism Superchain, thereby providing crucial financial tools to populations that need blockchain infrastructure the most. We intend to support various issuers and currencies, including yield-bearing stablecoins, to foster a robust, multi-currency ecosystem. Plan 1. Support for the Two Most Liquid USD Stablecoins Tether (USDT) Deployment: USDT contract on Lisk. Rationale: USDT is widely used in emerging markets and serves as the primary on/off-ramp option. Circle (USDC) Deployment: USDC contract on Lisk (pending deployment for all Superchain members by OP). Rationale: USDC is the most popular trading pair in DeFi and crucial for trading against RWAs. Liquidity Incentives Lisk will incentivize liquidity for USDT and USDC pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Velodrome and Oku.Trade. 2. Multi-Currency Ecosystem Initial Currency Support Partners/Targets Tokenized Euros (EUR): EURC from Circle EURA from Angle Tokenized South African Rand (ZAR): FZAR by FiveWest, a local partner of Circle ZARCoin Tokenized Indonesian Rupiahs (IDR) IDRT Others, as part of our Partnership with the Government of Indonesia 3. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Yield-bearing stablecoins represent an innovative development in RWAs. We foresee their widespread adoption and plan to support the following: stUSD from Angle Yield Source: Tokenized US Treasury Bills and leverage demand in Morpho lending markets. USDM from Mountain Yield Source: US Treasury Bills sUSDe from Ethena Yield Source: Cash-and-carry trades on BTC and ETH. 4. FZAR / USDC Pool on Lisk The FZAR / USDC pool aims to provide South Africans with a yield opportunity from exposure to ZAR/USD. The pool will benefit from swap fees, interest airdrops and LSK incentives, leveraging FiveWest’s client base involved in South African arbitrage. We expect this pool to offer very attractive returns (30%+) and grow to $300k within several months.

UPDATE - 28 August 2024:
Providing the metrics that we track as a chain to measure the success of our Ecosystem Growth activities, in response to the feedback received from the Grants Council:


GOAL: 1 trophy app
METRICS: 
- Organic, industry-wide PR
- Users joining the network specifically for this app


GOAL:  10 existing apps that users love
METRICS:
- 5 million Transactions Per Month (top 20 L2 Beat)
- 50 Apps on Lisk



GOAL: 10 apps with airdrops / token launch planned on Lisk 
METRICS: 
- Stable Monthly active user numbers in 6+ months



GOAL:  $400 million in TVL
METRICS:   
- More than $100m non-LSK TVL
- Top 15 on L2Beat at Launch



GOAL: 100k new verified users in Africa and South East Asia (our focus markets)
METRICS: 
- # New Lisk wallet addresses 
- Github ID, Worldcoin Users, etc. (for clear user base in our target markets and assess uniqueness)

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** Scoring and Ranking: Projects are scored based on the evaluation criteria. Scores are used to rank projects and determine funding priorities. Milestone-Based Disbursement: Funds are disbursed based on the achievement of predefined milestones. Each milestone is associated with specific deliverables and timelines. Regular progress reports are required to ensure accountability and transparency. Update - 29 July 2024 Please note: We estimate the grants to be distributed roughly in equal/comparable proportions to the following categories at this time: a) Our existing programs that were highlighted in the application: For example, the Lisk Grants Program which is an open-ended competitive grants program with public applications that we administer in waves b) Future ecosystem participants as part of our active BD operations: They are made up of both outbound projects that we reach out to and inbound projects that we meet at events, reach out to us directly or are introduced to us through our network.

# Optimism relationship

- **Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions:** We prioritize the same metrics as OP Mainnet Grants Council, with a higher emphasis placed on the top three currently (underlined below to highlight their increased priority) Growth: TVL in the grantee’s protocol Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Stickiness: Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts DAA/MAA ratio Developer Tooling: Number of testnet transactions emitting event logs Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts

# External Contributions:

- **Use of Grant-as-a-service provider:** We will distribute the tokens in line with our grants program process. The grant receivers will be informed of the OP Collective grant policies.
- **Contributions from non-team members:** - We incentivize and heavily encourage participants to launch their own tokens so that they are rooted in the Superchain
- Through our internal resources and external stakeholders, we will provide guidance and support so that each protocol can create a viable business model, ideally through their tokens, and focus on making their protocols self-sustainable (see next question for details)

# Compliance and Policies

- **Confirm understanding of clawback and milestone requirements:** yes
- **Confirmation of understanding grant policies:** yes
- **KYC information requirement:** Paper (gfxlabs)
- **Certification of legal compliance for token distribution:** Critical
