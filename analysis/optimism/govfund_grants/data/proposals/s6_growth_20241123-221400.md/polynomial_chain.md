# Project Details

- **If this is a resubmission from a declined Application, please provide the link to the previous Application, and briefly explain the main areas of improvement. If not please write (N/A):** All tokens received for user incentives must be given to end users. See the no-sale rule here .
- **Do you have a code audit for your project?:** Describe the process for evaluating and approving grants applications, including any decision-making bodies and timelines
- **Please briefly answer all project details questions:** List the individuals or groups responsible for making grant decisions and their qualifications

# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Specify the goals and objectives of the grants program, such as increasing TVL, launching new protocols, or attracting new users from specific categories

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We understand that we need to abide by the Collective Grant Policies, and that as an OP Chain receiving a grant we must: (1) make grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** Polynomial is rapidly becoming a key player in the Superchain, particularly in the derivatives space, as our Total Value Locked (TVL) and trading volume continue to grow. Our grants program is designed to boost liquidity and spur development across the Superchain, positioning our derivatives superchain as the go-to liquidity layer for all derivatives, while also serving as a launchpad for projects expanding within the Superchain. Key Initiatives: Unified Liquidity Layer : We’re establishing Polynomial as the main liquidity provider for derivatives within the Superchain, ensuring smooth integration and robust liquidity support for all projects. Developer Incentives : We’re offering incentives to developers and contributors to build and expand within the Polynomial ecosystem, driving innovation that benefits not just us but the entire Superchain community. Derivatives Ecosystem Enhancement : We’re backing the development and integration of various DeFi protocols, especially those focused on perpetual derivatives, with a strong emphasis on projects that enhance the entire Superchain ecosystem. Increased Revenue : As Polynomial grows, Optimism benefits as well, thanks to our Revenue Share agreement, contributing to the broader success of the Superchain.

# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** yes
- **Fill out your metric objective:** Polynomial will create dashboards to track progress metrics and produce a comprehensive formal report at the end of the program to the Grants Council. 

Key Progress Metrics include Number of New Projects on Polynomial Chain, User Growth, Total Value Locked (TVL), Transaction Volume, Contracts deployed on Polynomial, Sequencer Profit, ETH Contributed to the Optimism Collective, Grants distributed and New users on Polynomial Chain.
 
The formal report will cover successes, areas for improvement, program structure evaluation, and a before-and-after analysis of all target metrics.

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** We intend to run an open-ended competitive grants program with public applications. These applications will then undergo the two-step evaluation process of ' Initial Screening' and ' Evaluation Phase' explained above. The program will be a blend of open-ended competitive grants for all projects, invite-only grants for strategic initiatives aligned with our ecosystem’s goals, and targeted support for pre-identified projects that we want to collaborate with. Grant Sizes: Most projects are expected to receive grants ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 OP. Exceptional initiatives and established protocols may qualify for grants up to 100,000 OP. Approval Philosophy: The focus is on awarding "smaller" grants quickly to support teams that demonstrate the ability to grow and manage funds effectively. "Smaller" grants also help us is casting a wider net and onboarding exceptional people to the Superchain early on. This approach also ensures an environment where we are continuously backing promising projects as they progress and achieve milestones Grant Allocation Categories and Distribution: Initial Bootstrapping (35%): Provide liquidity incentives for DEXes on Polynomial to kickstart market depth and engagement. This includes launching liquidity mining programs on the most active platforms to ensure robust initial liquidity. Protocol Activity (30%): Drive trading activity and institutional participation by supporting projects that boost transaction volume and active use of the Polynomial liquidity layer. Encourage the deployment of innovative trading strategies and lending protocols. Technical Integrations (15%): Support the integration of third-party technologies, such as oracles and bridges, that facilitate seamless interaction within the Polynomial ecosystem and the broader Superchain. Infrastructure Development (10%): Fund projects focused on building essential infrastructure, including Indexers, Explorers, RPCs and price feeds, that enhance the overall functionality and user experience within the ecosystem. Security (10%): Invest in regular audits and security enhancements to ensure the integrity and safety of the Polynomial and Superchain networks. This helps maintain trust and protect users from vulnerabilities.

# Optimism relationship

- **Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions:** We will follow the metrics used by Grants Council, with greater emphasis on growth metrics. Growth: TVL in the grantee’s protocol Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Stickiness: Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts DAA/MAA ratio Developer Tooling: Number of testnet transactions emitting event logs Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts

# External Contributions:

- **Use of Grant-as-a-service provider:** Polynomial will use a multisig to distribute grants to successful applicants after KYC.

User incentive grants will be distributed after KYC completion. 

Grants will be distributed based on milestone completion to ensure teams stay motivated and on track, with incentives tied to achieving the goals.
- **Contributions from non-team members:** The insights gained from this program will be crucial for any future grants programs.

We will offer guidance and support to all grantees through our internal resources and external stakeholders to help develop a viable business model.

# Compliance and Policies

- **Confirm understanding of clawback and milestone requirements:** yes
- **Confirmation of understanding grant policies:** yes
- **KYC information requirement:** Jack Anorak
- **Certification of legal compliance for token distribution:** Critical
