# Project Details

- **If this is a resubmission from a declined Application, please provide the link to the previous Application, and briefly explain the main areas of improvement. If not please write (N/A):** Why is what they are going to build novel or valuable to Optimism? The most important value is to bring client diversity to optimism and help it achieve its decentralization intention. At present, Ethereum already has clients implemented in several programming languages, and there is already a Java-based client, which occupies a certain proportion of deployment. While there is currently no Java-based client on the OP stack, we are the first team to provide a Java version of op-node, which seems like a cool thing. How is this project likely to bring and keep new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? The Java ecosystem is a large community, the Java client could attract many Java developers. Teku/Besu(Java) ranks third in the proportion of Ethereum client running nodes. Hildr/op-besu can make it easy for these users to run OP Stack nodes, making it easy for these users to enter the OP Stack ecosystem. What are some comparable projects? What differentiates this one? For Hildr(Java), magi(Rust) and op-node(Go) are comparable projects, but because they all use different languages, they are complementary. For op-besu(Java), op-reth(Rust), op-erigon(Go), op-geth(Go) and op-nethermind(.Net) are comparable projects, also because they all use different languages, they are complementary. Will this project be fee-based or free to the end user?
Free.
Will this project pay for any portion of the service?
No.
Will this project be open-source?
Yes.
- **Do you have a code audit for your project?:** 1. What makes them well-positioned to accomplish your project goals? 2. Is this their first Web3 project? 3. If not, share links to their other projects (e.g., Github repository). 4. Have they worked on anything in the Optimism ecosystem?
- **Please briefly answer all project details questions:** If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway this project has. If there is an active need for financial support, please outline.

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** No. Context of Scope: code changes op-besu: https://optimism-java.github.io/op-besu/ (op java https://github.com/optimism-java/op-besu) : +3729 sloc code changes https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-utilities : 6,231 sloc https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-node : 10,286 sloc
- **Full list of the projectâ€™s labeled contracts:** Given the nature of the codebase, in terms of nloc, complexity of code and skills required the best solution would be to leverage a Cantina security competition. We can look to utilise our network of 1000+ security researchers to participate in the engagement. This project will be fully open source and a Cantina competition will align with open source ethos of this project - we will also look to invite security researchers on our end with the valid expertise and skill set needed for this scope. Context of Audit Scope: code changes op-besu: https://optimism-java.github.io/op-besu/ (op java https://github.com/optimism-java/op-besu ) : +3729 sloc code changes https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-utilities : 6,231 sloc https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr/tree/main/hildr-node : 10,286 sloc We would recommend a competition rewards pot of 94,191 - OP tokens and 43,171 OP tokens for administration, facilitation and judging of the competition. This codebase is large with of medium complexity making Cantina competitions a great fit here for security coverage. Upon review given complexity, assessment of team, plus the service/strategy recommended Cantina competitions. We do not anticipate needing any extensions, but if we encounter anything that would indicate the need for extensions we will inform the client immediately. A fix review period at the end of the competition will be handled and picked from the top peformers of the competition and this review period will be scoped based exactly on the fixes/remediations created, so no extension would be needed for that.
