# Project Details

- **If this is a resubmission from a declined Application, please provide the link to the previous Application, and briefly explain the main areas of improvement. If not please write (N/A):** All tokens received for user incentives must be given to end users. See the no-sale rule here .
- **Do you have a code audit for your project?:** Describe the process for evaluating and approving grants applications, including any decision-making bodies and timelines
- **Please briefly answer all project details questions:** List the individuals or groups responsible for making grant decisions and their qualifications

# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Specify the goals and objectives of the grants program, such as increasing TVL, launching new protocols, or attracting new users from specific categories

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We understand that we need to abide by the Collective Grant Policies, and that as an OP Chain receiving a grant we must: (1) make grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** The grants program will empower Fraxtal to accelerate its growth and enhance scalability significantly. With this grant, Fraxtal can strategically leverage it to attract additional projects to its platform, boost Total Value Locked (TVL), and expand its user base on the Superchain. A primary goal of this grant is to foster the growth of developers and projects launching on Fraxtal, thereby enriching Superchain ecosystem.

# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** yes
- **Fill out your metric objective:** Impact Assessment:

The impact of the grants program will be assessed through a combination of key performance indicators (KPIs), periodic reviews, and continuous monitoring. The primary metrics for assessment will include TVL, transaction volumes, user engagement, and protocol adoption rates. Specific milestones will serve as benchmarks for success.

Reporting:

To ensure transparency and accountability, the following reporting mechanisms will be implemented:

Monthly Reports: Detailed monthly reports will be provided, outlining the progress of the grants program, the utilization of funds, and the achievement of key milestones. These reports will include data on TVL growth, transaction volumes, and other relevant KPIs.

Real-Time Dashboard: A real-time dashboard will be available for stakeholders to monitor the grants program's performance continuously. This dashboard will provide up-to-date information on TVL, transaction volumes, and other key metrics, ensuring full transparency.

Example of Reporting:

For reference, we have implemented similar reporting mechanisms for the Arbitrum STIP grant for liquidity incentivization grant. An example of this reporting can be found bellow. This example showcases our commitment to transparency and detailed reporting. https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-bi-weekly-update-final-update/22960

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** We are looking for two types of grants: Liquidity Incentives (User Directed):
Incentives would be distributed toward pools and vaults within any protocol upon technical review and approval by the team. The underlying liquidity within each pool should be as follows: USD Stablecoins and derivatives ETH Stablecoins and derivatives Any other assets upon approval Protocol Incentives (Locked): This grant will be a brand new grant program, which will be distributed between developers or protocols that deploy or integrate with Fraxtal, this budget will mostly focus to bring more analytics, and off-chain protocols into Fraxtal ecosystem. This program would be an open-ended grant program and protocols can apply for that either through Frax Finance standard Governance process or directly convince Frax Finance Core team.

# Optimism relationship

- **Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions:** Growth: TVL in the grantee’s protocol Number of transactions emitting event logs Number of active addresses FXTL Points Stickiness: Percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts

# External Contributions:

- **Use of Grant-as-a-service provider:** Tokens will be distributed via the grant program through two main types of incentives: Liquidity Incentives (User Directed) and Protocol Incentives (Locked). 

Liquidity incentives will be allocated for USD stablecoins and derivatives, ETH stablecoins and derivatives, and other approved assets. Distribution will be automated and correlated with TVL and trading volume to stimulate growth. 

Protocol incentives will be milestone-based, rewarding projects for achieving specific TVL, transaction volume, and other KPIs defined by the Frax team. The process will be transparent, with regular reports and a real-time dashboard, ensuring compliance with grant policies and fair distribution based on performance.
- **Contributions from non-team members:** This grant will help kickstart our DeFi ecosystem by providing the initial funding needed to grow and attract users and liquidity. Once established, our financial products and subprotocols will begin generating revenue through lending yields, staking reward, and protocol fees. This will create a sustainable income stream, allowing the grants program to continue supporting innovation and growth within the Fraxtal ecosystem without relying solely on external funding.

# Compliance and Policies

- **Confirmation of understanding grant policies:** yes
