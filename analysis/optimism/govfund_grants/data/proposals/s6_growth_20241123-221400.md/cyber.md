# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We understand that we need to abide by the Collective Grant Policies, and that as an OP Chain receiving a grant we must: (1) make grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** Our vision is to establish Cyber as the Superchain’s home for social applications, similar to Mode’s role in DeFi. During the past several months, we have been focused on positioning Cyber as the Superchain’s social hub and a key entry point for developers building innovative social apps, as well as users passionate about onchain social. Through our Superchain Social Summer Campaign , we've raised awareness about Cyber's mission among 140K+ users with over 2M+ NFT mints . We want our grants program to build on this momentum, providing incentives for founders and developers to actively contribute to the Cyber ecosystem. Our goal is to incubate applications and establish Cyber as a chain for experimentation for applications with social features. As the Superchain’s member chains become interoperable, we envision that features developed on Cyber will be embedded into applications across other OP chains, adding value to the broader ecosystem that exceeds the sum of its parts. The social features and applications developed on Cyber will become integrable with other applications on OP chains, enabling different types of apps on various OP chains to become more engaging through social features built on Cyber. For our next phase, we are looking to onboard more developers building web3 social applications. Cyber has been chosen as the home base by several social applications already, and we are actively expanding our ecosystem for many ways. We are in talks with many existing projects building at the frontier of Web3 social. We are in close conversation with dscvr.one , one of the largest social apps on Solana with 70K DAU , and UXLink , the largest social platform on Arbitrum , to bring them and similar projects, onto Cyber and the Superchain. As the only chain for social in the Superchain ecosystem and the L2 landscape, we would love to have Optimism Governance’s support in our mission to become the home base for web3 social applications.

# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** yes
- **Fill out your metric objective:** We will establish comprehensive tracking panels to monitor key metrics, aligning with our Mandate and Allocation Framework. These will be made open-source for transparency. To ensure effectiveness, we will provide ongoing support to grant recipients, including engineering retrospectives, GTM assistance, and investor intros. 

At the program's conclusion, we will produce a detailed report evaluating successes, areas for improvement, and metric comparisons. A retrospective session will be held to discuss the program’s impact and refine future strategies for Cyber's ecosystem growth.

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** Cyber Qualified Social Dapp Grants Program: Invite only - 50K OP (Mandate #1) What is the team’s track record? Have they built and deployed successfully on Ethereum or L2s in the past? How many TXs will the team aim to bring to Cyber? How many new users will team bring to Cyber and the Superchain? What is the presumed time investment of building this project? Is there a reasonable tradeoff between investment of time/energy and time to deployment? Cyber Social Buildathon: 6 tracks - 50K OP (Mandate #1 and #3) What is the team’s track record? Have they built any consumer apps, or other projects in the Ethereum ecosystem before, or is this their first attempt? Is it open source and easy for the community to maintain? Does the team intend to (or have they) deploy(ed) in a reasonable amount of time (<1-3 months) Cyber X Farcaster Builder Grant - 75K OP total rewards (Mandate #1 and #2) Does the project demonstrate a novel approach or solve a problem not yet addressed in Web3 social applications? Does the project leverage Cyber's infrastructure with an onchain component, ensuring alignment with the ecosystem's vision? What is the potential impact of the project on growing the Cyber ecosystem, both socially and technically? Is the project designed to scale efficiently across Cyber’s Layer 2 infrastructure? Does the project engage and onboard users from diverse backgrounds or communities, including non-crypto users? Sponsoring events in the Cyber ecosystem - 25K OP total rewards (Mandate #4) Has the team previously demonstrated success in hosting events? What is the largest event they have organized or co-hosted? What is the target number of attendees for this event? Who is the intended audience, and from which industries are they expected? Will the event engage participants beyond the traditional crypto community? What is the event's format and primary objective? Will it feature any projects building in the Cyber & Superchain ecosystem? Cyber Wallet Partners Grant - 62.5K OP total rewards (Mandate #5) How quickly and securely can the wallet provider integrate with Cyber mainnet and support user onboarding? What is the potential for the wallet provider to bring in new users, and what strategies do they have in place to retain them within the Cyber ecosystem? How much transaction activity is expected to be generated by users through the wallet provider's platform on Cyber mainnet? How committed is the wallet provider to co-marketing efforts, and does their brand align with Cyber’s values and ecosystem? Does the wallet provider offer unique features that enhance the user experience and contribute to the broader development of the Cyber ecosystem?

# External Contributions:

- **Use of Grant-as-a-service provider:** We will use a multisig to distribute grants to successful applicants after KYC.

User incentive grants will be distributed at the time of KYC completion, and locked grants will be distributed 1 year after successful application if milestones are completed.
- **Contributions from non-team members:** Having completed one round of Cyber Ecosystem Grants, we have already incorporated learnings from the pilot round into our grants program. For example, for Round II, applicants were told encouraged to describe their milestones in the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) format to ensure clarity and accountability. This was based on the learning from the first round, where applicants milestone format varied significantly, which made them less comparable. 

The establishment of metrics and milestones in the evaluation process for Cyber ecosystem projects reflects our commitment to fostering long-term, sustainable initiatives within the Cyber ecosystem. As has already been done, the lessons learned during every round of the existing program and new programs will be incorporated into any future grants programs. 

We have several processes in place to ensure that grant recipients can sustain themselves beyond the initial grants. First of all, this is one of the areas projects are assessed on during the evaluation process. Additionally, after being selected, projects receive ongoing support and are eligible for follow-on grants after successfully completing the program if they meet their milestones. For example, XO, a dating app built on Cyber and popular in Taiwan and Asia, was a grantee in the pilot round and was also selected for a second round of grants. This allowed them to expand their scope and set new milestones after their initial success.

We also offer ongoing support in various ways. Beyond funding, we provide mentorship, make introductions to investors and partners, and co-market projects to maximize their chances of success. XO is also a great example for this, as we are assisting their team with their Series A fundraising. In general, we have a strong network of investors and partners and always aim to connect Cyber-based projects with funding when needed.

In terms of the sustainability of the grants program overall, we have plans to apply for follow-on grants and are working to identify additional revenue streams that can be allocated toward sustaining our existing and future grant programs. One potential approach is using a portion of fees generated from specific campaigns to maintain the grants programs—for example, dedicating 20% of revenue generated from specific campaigns like next year's Social Summer. This is merely an illustrative example, as the best revenue stream is still being evaluated.
