# Project Details

- **If this is a resubmission from a declined Application, please provide the link to the previous Application, and briefly explain the main areas of improvement. If not please write (N/A):** Why are they going to succeed? There is an issue of overcollateralization in Defi due to high crypto volatility that leads to 2X the amount of crypto collateral required to mint stablecoin on-chain. There is an issue of bad liquidation experience with assets getting liquidated at >10% the market price. Then there's an issue of complicated derivative products in Defi which isn’t well understood by users and also leads to liquidity fragmentation. There's also the issue of users losing their token holdings if some Dapp gets hacked due to security vulnerabilities in Dapps. Our product addresses all these issues. At the most basic level, it’s a stablecoin backed by decentralized credit default swaps(dCDS)  that allows users to borrow stablecoins without worrying about the crypto volatility. The product can be used with any level of knowledge as we completely abstract the derivatives part required to hedge the collateral volatility. The product is built to scale easily for any type of collateral as long as there's someone to provide a credit protection market like dCDS for the same. We are currently live on testnet with 1600+ users in our waitlist signups and won 2 accelerator competitions from Mode L2 blockchain and Soonami.io Venture Fund among 500+ projects. We are part of Mode L2 yield accelerator and received grants from Mode & Joseon DAO. We have support from Cookie community, Yard[Hub] fund for liquidity enablement and projects on Mode chain to ensure the success of this product. Why is what they are going to build novel or valuable to Optimism? Optimism ecosystem users will be getting a new way to hedge against crypto volatility through a combination of a stablecoin & derivative mechanism. The users are not required to give anything out of their pocket initially to pay for hedging costs of the crypto asset. The decentralized credit default swaps (dCDS) is the first instrument in the space where users' speculation activity is turned into a sustainable source of fees earning mechanism for them. Users speculation which was not serving any purpose before now will be able to provide credit risk protection to borrowers looking for loans. The product overall enhances the capital efficiency by allowing users to borrow stablecoin at 100% synthetic LTV. As more & more stablecoins come into the market, the dCDS will allow them to put to good use and become the highest provider of yields on stablecoin deposits across the entire market. The ‘Colored Dollar’ token architecture will bring better security & peace of mind for users to not be worried about losing their token deposits during hacks across Dapp which is the biggest issue on enabling crypto in user’s daily lives. The project will offer the highest ever yield opportunity on stablecoins thus bringing a long term sustainable value to users and ecosystem. How is this project likely to bring and keep new builders to the Optimism ecosystem Users can build on top of the dCDS and explore different markets wherever volatility risk management or credit risk protection is required. As more & more RWAs are tokenized, users & institutions are expecting to use tokenized RWAs across Defi but we need a good credit risk protection mechanism like dCDS to enable that. Existing Dapps or upcoming Dapps on the Optimism ecosystem can utilize the ‘Colored Dollar’ architecture for better security for their tokens. What are some comparable projects?  What differentiates this one? We are the first one bringing the decentralized credit default swaps (dCDS) in the market where users can offer credit risk protection to any user looking to hedge downside risk. Our yield bearing stablecoin product has many competitors and the closest one is ‘Ethena’. Ethena offers a delta neutral synthetic stablecoin design where they are able to provide higher amounts of yields on stablecoin issued through delta hedging the crypto across different Perp products in CEX venues. However, Autonomint has created an in-house delta neutral mechanism facilitated with decentralized credit default swaps (dCDS) so that we can reduce the risks associated with reliance on external Perp products on CEXes. We can create a dCDS market for any new token in house itself with higher payoffs then what are offered by Perps. There are many lending & borrowing protocols in the market but it still isn’t possible to enable undercollateralized loans in Defi similar to TradFi space. We will make it possible through clever user incentive design allowing other users to sponsor loans for people with needs. S ervice providers: Have you worked on projects similar to this one? We've audited several projects similar to Autonomint, which are stablecoin protocols incorporating options, including: Tapioca DAO, which features a stablecoin and options as its main logic. Flat Money, a protocol allowing users to deposit Rocket Pool ETH (rETH) and mint UNIT, a decentralized delta-neutral flatcoin designed to outpace inflation. It also offers leverage trading by enabling deposits of rETH to open leveraged long positions through perpetual futures contracts. UXD Protocol, a fully collateralized decentralized stablecoin backed by delta-neutral positions using derivatives. Smilee Protocol, a decentralized options protocol disrupting DeFi with the first-ever Impermanent Gain options, offering up to 1,000x leverage with no liquidations. Will this project be fee-based or free to the end user? The dCDS product is free to use and instead users will earn passive income on the same. There will be borrowing fees in yield bearing stablecoin product which will be nullified through the yields earned on collateral deposited. There will be no hedging costs charged initially to participate in the hedging of crypto assets. We only will take a percentage of collateral upside and a percentage of collateral downside protected during hedging to cover for our costs and generate revenue. Will this project pay for any portion of the service? Yes, the project will be able to pay for 25% of the service costs. The total requested OP already accounts for the protocol team, covering 25% of the service costs. Will this project be open-source? Yes, the project will be fully open source.
- **Do you have a code audit for your project?:** 1. What makes them well-positioned to accomplish your project goals? 2. Is this their first Web3 project? 3. If not, share links to their other projects (e.g., Github repository). 4. Have they worked on anything in the Optimism ecosystem?
- **Please briefly answer all project details questions:** If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway this project has. If there is an active need for financial support, please outline.

# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Please describe if so and any mitigation measures taken.

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** No
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** The codebase consists of approximately 3,084 nSLOC and includes several important components within the contracts directory. Key contracts likely encompass: Core Logic Contracts: These handle the fundamental functionalities of the protocol, including stablecoin issuance, options management, and treasury operations. They are critical for maintaining the protocol's financial mechanisms and ensuring stability and security in minting and redeeming processes. Token Contracts: Representing the stablecoin and possibly associated tokens such as option tokens or governance tokens. These contracts manage token creation, transfers, and compliance with ERC standards, ensuring seamless interaction within the ecosystem. Library and Utility Contracts: These provide reusable code and helper functions that support various operations across the protocol. Contracts like BorrowLib.sol, CDSLib.sol, Colors.sol, and TreasuryLib.sol might be included to facilitate low-level operations, data management, and complex calculations. Given the low complexity of the codebase, especially considering our extensive experience with similar stablecoin and options protocols, the audit is estimated to take around 19 days.
