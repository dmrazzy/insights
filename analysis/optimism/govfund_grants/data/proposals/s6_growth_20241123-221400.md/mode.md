# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Specify the goals and objectives of the grants program, such as increasing TVL, launching new protocols, or attracting new users from specific categories

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We understand that we need to abide by the Collective Grant Policies, and that as an OP Chain receiving a grant we must: (1) make grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** For the past few months, we have been focusing on fostering a healthy and active DeFi ecosystem filled with opportunities for users. Our goal with this grants program is not only to make Mode the DeFi playground of the Superchain, but also to serve as a launchpad for projects that want to expand across the Superchain. We want to use this grants program to make this “DefI playground” the most vibrant of any crypto ecosystem. All of our program mandates aim at empowering and increasing the incentives for developers and founders to become active participants in the Mode ecosystem. This grants program will allow us to incentivize emerging and existing projects to not only come to Mode but also run growth campaigns to attract more users and activity.

# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** yes
- **Fill out your metric objective:** Impact Assessment:

The impact of the grants program will be assessed through a combination of key performance indicators (KPIs), periodic reviews, and continuous monitoring. The primary metrics for assessment will include TVL, transaction volumes, user engagement, and protocol adoption rates. Specific milestones will serve as benchmarks for success as mentioned in the above section. 

The tracking dashboards to be used are https://dune.com/sealaunch/mode-network https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/mode#tvl https://app.tokenflow.live/studio/dashboards/modedexs https://defillama.com/chain/Mode https://explorer.mode.network/stats Reporting:

To ensure transparency and accountability, the following reporting mechanisms will be implemented:

Monthly Reports: Detailed monthly reports will be provided, outlining the progress of the grants program, the utilization of funds, and the achievement of key milestones. These reports will include data on TVL growth, transaction volumes, and other relevant KPIs.

Real-Time Dashboard: A real-time dashboard will be available for stakeholders to monitor the grants program's performance continuously. This dashboard will provide up-to-date information on TVL, transaction volumes, and other key metrics, ensuring full transparency of grant distribution. 

End of program retrospective & reporting: Mode will create a comprehensive report at the conclusion of the program, covering the following questions
      - Biggest successes
      - Areas that need to improve
      - Evaluation on the program structure
      - Before and after analysis of all target metrics

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** The Grants Allocation Framework comprises two distinct programs, each offering 1.5M OP to eligible projects. Grantees can qualify for only one program at a time. The two programs—Yield Accelerator and Mode Momentum—are designed to support projects at various stages of development, all with the overarching goal of fulfilling the Defined Mandate above. Yield Accelerator  100K OP (100k for Builder Grant) Description: A quarterly, open-to-public program targeting 15 teams per cycle, offering hands-on support to launch new projects on Mode. The program focuses on fostering meaningful innovation and developing new mechanisms that drive user adoption. Within a year, It is anticipated that at least 10 new projects will be deployed on Mode, assuming an 80% success rate of teams making significant progress and graduating from the program. The grant will consist of 100k OP Builder Grant. This amount will be enough to cover for the AIFi accelerator cohort hosting 1 program. Target stage: This program targets MVP-to-testnet stage projects that require a final push to fully develop their products, with a go-to-market timeline of 1-3 months. Elegibility: Projects successfully graduated the program will receive the grants to cover the product development, security audit cost, and bootstrap early users. Grants are reviewed by a minimum of 3 team members on a standard rubric ( Mode Grants Rubric Draft ). The projects are expected to expand to the Superchain ecosystem and deploy on other chains after the launch on Mode. Mode Momentum 900k OP (900K for User Incentive) Description: This program operates on a rolling basis, activated when existing projects on Mode demonstrate significant and measurable improvements in traction and user adoption. For instance, if a multichain project with a $500M TVL deploys on Mode and successfully transfers 10% of its TVL from other chains (outside the Superchain ecosystem) to Mode, the project can retroactively apply for this grant as a reward. The goal of this program is to attract well-known protocols to the Mode ecosystem, thereby enhancing market awareness and credibility for Mode. Target stage: This program targets mature projects that have been fully developed and operational on Mode for at least 3 months. Elegibility: This program is designed to incentivize the growth of mature projects on Mode, specifically addressing the challenge of multichain deployment that does not directly result in user adoption from other ecosystems or TVL migration from other chains outside of superchain. To be eligible, a protocol must deploy on Mode and demonstrate that it has migrated at least 10% of its TVL to Mode. To distinguish between early-stage and mature-stage projects, the project must have a minimum of $25M in TVL(data will be sourced and tracked from Defillama at the time of deployment) across all chains (outside of the Superchain ecosystem). Allocation Eligibility Review Process All applications from the above 2 defined programs will go through a two-step process. Mode team will provide feedback on grant sizes that teams request in the application process. We are expecting to give grants of sizes 5K-100K USD for most projects. The main idea is to give "smaller" sized grants but to have a fast paced approval to keep supporting the teams that demonstrate an ability to grow and manage these funds in a proper manner. Intake phase Grants applications are reviewed by 1 team member for the following pass/fail criteria: Commpleteness Within scope of grants program Follows grant rules Review phase Grants are reviewed by a minimum of 3 team members on a standard rubric (Mode Grants Rubric Draft) If grants meet a threshold score (TBD) they will pass the review stage and move on to distribution Threshold score increases based on grant size request Any Mode team member will have a “golden buzzer” for high-conviction projects that will have them pass the review phase regardless of score. This grants program will encompass a blend of three distinct approaches: Open-Ended Competitive Grants Program with Public Applications: This will allow for a wide range of projects to apply for funding, leaving an open end for new projects to contact our team for support. We want to be as open to the community as possible. Invite-Only Competitive Grants Program: This component will target strategic projects that align closely with our ecosystem’s objectives, allowing us to support key initiatives proactively. It will help our BD and Ecosystem team to utilize this grant as a tool to help the growth in the Mode and Superchain ecosystem. Support for Pre-Identified Grantees: We aim to formalize the support for pre-identified projects that are already part of our pipeline. These projects have shown significant potential and require our assistance to scale effectively. Currently, we have more than 10 projects, including BMX, Ironclad, Charged Particles, Reserve, Splice, Ionic, Giza (AI agents), and Gyro, ready to launch growth campaigns under this program. Collectively, these projects represent a substantial opportunity to expand and strengthen our ecosystem. The balance between these different grant types will be flexible, allowing us to respond dynamically to the evolving needs of our ecosystem while ensuring that both new and established projects receive the support they need.

# Optimism relationship

- **Please briefly answer all Optimism relationship questions:** Mandate 1 Foster User Engagement and Growth: ⁠# of new accounts created. This number can be used as a proxy of user engagement and growth. we can set quarterly goals e.g. 15%  quarterly growth rate; this means roughly 300K new accounts in a year. ⁠ # of transactions . This number is less optimal for this mandate but it can be somewhat supplementary to the first one. DEX Volume: Mode is #19 w. ~13M in daily volume, in the mid-term we'd like to get to top 10. DEX TVL (filter the chart above by "DEX TVL": Mode is at #48 w. ~13M in TVL. this is where we need a lot more improvement and where the OP incentives would play a critical part to get this DEX TVL number up so that we can support larger trades with less price impact and slippage DEX volume is at the heart of onchain activity for Defi, which also unlocks other areas of defi growth such as lending (more depth to handle larger liquidations means lending protocols can handle larger borrowing needs). While we are off to a great start, we can take things to the next level with the right amount of support from the OP grants. Improving DEX liquidity and TVL will also Mode to grow even faster all all cylinders Stickiness: The number of active addresses and the percentage of retained active addresses interacting with the grantee’s contracts The total amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contracts Mandate 2 Promote Innovation and User Adoption of Novel Protocols: # of unique applications deployed on Mode . We can define the uniqueness as not available in other ecosystems, or native token on mode with multichain strategy, or from our accelerator program. Mandate 3 Attract Established Multichain Protocols and Multichain Assets: For multichain established projects, the best metrics would be # of applications deployed and % of TVL of overall TVL of that project. Mandate 4 Invest in Infrastructure and Developer Tooling For developer tooling and infrastructure providers, we will use the # of testnet transactions emitting event logs and # of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contracts

# External Contributions:

- **Use of Grant-as-a-service provider:** Mode will use a multisig to distribute grants to successful applicants after KYC. 

User incentive grants will be distributed at the time of KYC completion, and locked grants will be distributed 1 year after successful application if all milestones are completed.
- **Contributions from non-team members:** The lessons learned during this program will be essential for any future grants programs.

# Compliance and Policies

- **Confirm understanding of clawback and milestone requirements:** yes
- **Confirmation of understanding grant policies:** yes
- **KYC information requirement:** Jack Anorak
- **Certification of legal compliance for token distribution:** Critical
