# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Specify the goals and objectives of the grants program, such as increasing TVL, launching new protocols, or attracting new users from specific categories

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We understand that we need to abide by the Collective Grant Policies, and that as an OP Chain receiving a grant we must: (1) make grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** Mint Blockchain's grants program is designed to align with Intent #3B by driving growth in NFT-related applications within the Superchain. Our goal is to establish Mint as the premier hub for NFT protocols and use cases, encouraging developers to launch innovative projects that bring real-world utility to NFT assets. By fostering this ecosystem, we aim to increase transaction volume, user engagement, and overall gas consumption, contributing to the broader Superchain economy. Through this program, we seek to make Mint Blockchain the leading chain for NFTs, attracting developers, creators, and Web3 users alike. By incentivizing both emerging and existing projects, we will help expand the Superchain’s reach, offering new ways to onboard users from Web2 and build applications that enhance the onchain economy. This approach will not only grow Mint's ecosystem but also strengthen the entire Superchain through increased activity and cross-chain integration.

# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** yes
- **Fill out your metric objective:** The impact of the grants program will be assessed through a comprehensive evaluation of key metrics aligned with Mint blockchain ecosystem growth goals. We will establish open-source tracking panels for transparency, monitoring milestones such as transaction volume, active wallets, dApp integration, and TVL.

Throughout the program, we will provide ongoing support to grant recipients, including technical reviews, go-to-market (GTM) assistance, and strategic introductions. At the program's conclusion, a detailed report will be published to assess outcomes, highlight achievements, and identify areas for improvement. A retrospective session will be held to refine future strategies and optimize ecosystem development.

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** Mint Blockchain offers a structured and transparent framework for allocating grants to projects within its ecosystem. The process is divided into two main programs: the Builder Grant and the User Incentive Grant, each with a budget of 500K OP. The objective of these programs is to support projects that drive innovation, increase user adoption, and enhance the overall health of the ecosystem. Below is a summary of the criteria and process for both grant types, ensuring an equitable and impactful allocation. Builder Grant (500K OP) The Builder Grant is designed to support innovative dapps and infrastructure projects that contribute to the long-term sustainability of the Mint Blockchain ecosystem. Key evaluation criteria include: Impact: We assess how the project will contribute to the ecosystem in terms of transaction growth, user onboarding, and retention. Priority is given to projects expected to significantly scale within Mint and the broader Superchain. Deployment Timeline: We also consider how quickly and effectively the team can deploy their solution, with a preference for projects ready to launch within 1-3 months. Team’s Track Record: Preference is given to teams with proven experience in developing on Ethereum or L2 ecosystems especially on Mint Blockchain. This includes evaluating their past achievements and the technical complexity of their projects. Innovation and Alignment: Projects must demonstrate innovative approaches, ideally offering solutions not currently addressed in the ecosystem. Preference is given to those that align with Mint’s mission of advancing Web3 adoption through NFTs. User Incentive Grant (500K OP) The User Incentive Grant is focused on incentivizing user growth and engagement across the Mint Blockchain ecosystem. Key evaluation factors include: User Onboarding and Retention: Projects must present strategies for acquiring new users and retaining them over time. Grants will be awarded based on their ability to bring in a significant number of users or enhance user experiences within the ecosystem. Transaction Volume: A critical metric is the number of transactions the project is expected to generate, as this reflects user activity and ecosystem growth. Sustainability of Incentives: The long-term sustainability of the user incentive models is also a priority. Projects that demonstrate a clear plan for maintaining user activity beyond initial grant allocation will be prioritized. Both grant programs involve an objective review process, with final decisions based on clear metrics and the long-term value each project brings to Mint Blockchain. We remain open to providing additional details or insights into the grant allocation process upon request.
