# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** yes
- **Fill out your metric objective:** 1. Initial Impact Metrics Definition
Project Milestones: Clearly define specific milestones that each grantee must achieve. These could include technical deliverables, user engagement metrics, or partnership developments.
KPIs: Establish KPIs that align with the goals of the grant program, such as the number of active users, the degree of decentralization achieved, or the scalability of the solution developed.
Community Feedback: Incorporate metrics that capture community feedback and sentiment, as these can be strong indicators of the project's alignment with the broader ecosystem’s needs.

2. Continuous Monitoring and Reporting
Regular Updates: Grantees should provide regular updates, typically monthly or quarterly, that outline their progress toward the defined milestones and KPIs. These updates could be in the form of written reports, video presentations, or public blog posts.
Peer Review: Involve the broader community or a designated peer review panel in assessing the updates provided by grantees. This adds a layer of transparency and accountability.
Data-Driven Insights: Utilize data analytics tools to track the performance of the projects. This could include monitoring the project's blockchain transactions, user activity, or other relevant data points.

3. Retrospective Reports
Final Report Submission: At the conclusion of the project, grantees are required to submit a comprehensive final report. This report should detail the outcomes achieved, challenges faced, and lessons learned. It should also include an analysis of the impact metrics initially set.
Impact Analysis: Assess the project's overall impact on the ecosystem by comparing the outcomes with the initially defined goals. This includes evaluating the project's sustainability, its contribution to the community, and any unforeseen benefits or drawbacks.
Public Retrospective: Consider publishing a retrospective analysis for public viewing. This not only increases transparency but also provides insights to other projects and the broader community on what worked and what didn’t.

4. Post-Grantee Evaluation
Follow-Up Evaluation: Conduct follow-up evaluations at set intervals after the project's completion to assess long-term impacts and sustainability.
Ecosystem Integration: Evaluate how well the project has integrated into the broader ecosystem and whether it has continued to develop or inspired similar initiatives.

5. Transparent Reporting
Annual Impact Report: Compile the results from all funded projects into an annual impact report. This report should be shared with the community and stakeholders, highlighting the successes, challenges, and overall contribution of the grants program.
Public Dashboards: Consider creating a public dashboard that tracks ongoing projects in real time, showing key metrics, milestones achieved, and current status. This enhances transparency and allows the community to engage with and support grantees.

Monitoring and Compliance
•	(1)Grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).

•	Progress Reporting: Projects must submit regular progress reports at each milestone stage, detailing achievements and challenges. These reports will be reviewed to determine the eligibility for the next tranche of funding.
•	Token Release Conditions: Tokens will only be released once specific, pre-defined criteria are met. This ensures that the projects are on track and aligned with the overall objectives of the OP Superchain ecosystem.
•	Final Review: A comprehensive final review will be conducted to confirm that all goals have been achieved before the final disbursement.
Ongoing Support
* Mentorship and Guidance: Alongside the financial support, SwanChain will provide ongoing mentorship and technical guidance to help projects meet their milestones and overcome challenges.
* Long-Term Integration: The grant program is designed not only to fund projects but also to ensure their long-term success within the OP Superchain, fostering sustainable growth and innovation.
* This structured approach ensures that OP tokens are distributed in a manner that maximizes their impact, drives significant progress within the ecosystem, and aligns with the OP Superchain's grant policies.
- **Contributions from non-team members:** 1. Revenue Generation for Ongoing Support
a. Yield-Bearing Assets and TVL Growth
Strategy: As SwanChain successfully increases Total Value Locked (TVL) through high-yield DeFi projects and cross-chain asset integrations, the platform will generate revenue from transaction fees, yield farming, and liquidity provision.
Implementation: A portion of the revenue generated from these activities will be reinvested into the grants program, creating a self-sustaining model. For example, achieving the target of $50M in TVL will significantly increase transaction fees and yields, which can be partially allocated to fund future grants.

b. Gas Fees and Transaction Volume
Strategy: The deployment of new projects on SwanChain, particularly those involving high-frequency transactions and complex smart contracts, will generate significant gas fees. These fees will contribute to the overall revenue of the platform.
Implementation: As SwanChain reaches its goal of generating 2,500 ETH in gas fees over 12 months, a portion of these fees can be redirected to the grants fund. This approach ensures that as the platform grows, the grants program benefits from increased economic activity.

2. Strategic Partnerships and Co-Funding
a. Collaboration with Ecosystem Partners
Strategy: SwanChain will establish partnerships with other projects, organizations, and stakeholders within the OP Superchain. These partnerships can provide co-funding opportunities, shared resources, and collaborative ventures that enhance the grants program.
Implementation: By working with ecosystem partners, SwanChain can access additional funding pools, secure matching grants, or receive in-kind contributions that support the program’s sustainability.

b. Community-Driven Fundraising and DAO Involvement
Strategy: SwanChain may explore the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to manage and sustain the grants program. The DAO would allow community members to contribute funds and participate in decision-making.
Implementation: A DAO structure can enable ongoing community-driven fundraising, where contributors are incentivized to support the grants program. This approach ensures that the program remains aligned with the community’s needs and interests.

3. Reintegration of Profits from Successful Projects
a. Revenue Sharing and Reinvestment
Strategy: SwanChain will encourage successful grant-funded projects that generate revenue to reinvest a portion of their profits back into the grants program. This creates a cyclical model of funding where successful initiatives support the next wave of innovation.
Implementation: Grant agreements can include provisions for profit-sharing or reinvestment commitments from projects that achieve commercial success. This reinvestment helps to replenish the grants fund and supports the continuous development of the ecosystem.

4. Continuous Monitoring and Program Optimization
a. Performance-Based Adjustments
Strategy: The grants program will be continuously monitored and adjusted based on the performance of funded projects and the overall health of the OP Superchain ecosystem.
Implementation: Regular evaluations and feedback loops will inform decisions on reallocating funds, adjusting grant criteria, or scaling successful initiatives. This dynamic approach ensures that the program remains responsive and sustainable over time.

5. Long-Term Ecosystem Support and Engagement
a. Developer and Community Engagement
Strategy: Sustained engagement with developers and the broader community is essential for the long-term success of the grants program. SwanChain will continue to invest in educational initiatives, hackathons, and community-building activities that keep the ecosystem vibrant and innovative.
Implementation: Ongoing support for developer education, mentorship programs, and community events will help maintain high levels of participation and innovation within the OP Superchain. This engagement is crucial for the continuous generation of new project ideas and grant applications.
