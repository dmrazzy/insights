# Project Details

- **If this is a resubmission from a declined Application, please provide the link to the previous Application, and briefly explain the main areas of improvement. If not please write (N/A):** Why is what they are going to build novel or valuable to Optimism? Our project introduces a novel approach to yield-earning protocol design, enhancing end-user security in DeFi. By creating new incentive structures, we aim to bridge the gap between users and threat detection tools, security actors, and MEV searchers without compromising user experience or yield-earning potential. Earn Guardian addresses the need for seamless security layers for retail users earning yield on idle on-chain assets. This aligns with Optimism's mission – and that of partners like Base and Zora – to bring more users on-chain effortlessly. Furthermore, we think Earn Guardian would have proven most useful by protecting users' funds in hacks that affected Optimisms' users and our co-founders personally: Exactly and Sonne's. Additionally, we've implemented our vault architecture from scratch with the core focus on making it as flexible as possible, so other projects can take advantage of our novel implementation. In addition to the flexibility, we've designed the architecture to be highly scalable. Last, but not least our protocol is user friendly and does not require any advanced knowledge. Technological Superiority: Our project has a substantial likelihood of generating long-term, sustainable value for the Optimism ecosystem due to the user friendliness and our superior technology including: Modularized Yield Earning Vaults: Our implemented architecture aligns with lessons learned from leading lending markets (Morpho, AaveV4, EulerV2) by modularizing different component types of yield-earning vaults. By splitting concerns into separate smart contracts, we enable a variety of new permissionless behaviors and integrations. Single-Asset Multiple Rewards Vaults: In contrast to all known vault designs, our architecture allows for tracking shares of multiple rewards per deposit. This enables non-compounding strategies or percentage-based compounding strategies. For example, users could keep 30% of liquidity mined assets and auto-compound the remaining 70%, offering a new and flexible platform in which yield-earning strategies can be implemented. Permissionless Core: The core of our vault architecture allows for permissionless integration of any strategy without relying on allowlists or denylists. This empowers asset managers to focus on creating their strategies without getting bogged down in the complexities of implementing shares, deposit, withdrawal, or delayed withdrawal systems. Well Tested Architecture: We've prioritized robust testing to ensure reliability and security. Our codebase has rigorous testing implemented, including multiple invariant tests, fuzz tests, parameterized unit tests, and integration tests. Template Strategies: Our repository will include open-source implementations of template strategies for popular protocols like AaveV2, AaveV3, Compound, and Lido (with more to come afterwards). These templates serve as a starting point for developers, accelerating the process of creating new strategies and fostering innovation within the ecosystem. Direct competitors: Direct competitors for Earn itself include yield aggregators like Superform, Beefy, Yearn, and Harvest, but our unique Guardian feature sets us apart. How is this project likely to bring and keep new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? We believe our novel yield-earning architecture will create a new wave of yield-related products on Superchain's chains. Its modularized, permissionless, and well-tested nature allows for flexible integrations and new product development. Furthermore, our proposed "Guardians" approach can spark new security-related conversations and discussions on the decentralization threshold, particularly in areas like Sequencer security and transaction analysis. What are some comparable projects? What differentiates this one? Without the Guardian's architecture, earn-core is a more, better-tested modularized architecture for yield-earning vaults, allowing new things like separate tracking of base yield on a base asset and token rewards. Comparable yield-earning projects include Superform, Beefy, Yearn, Harvest, and other yield-aggregator platforms. Moreover, we are not aware of any project implementing an architecture similar to our proposed Guardian's architecture. Service providers: have you worked with similar projects as this one? Will this project be fee-based or free to the end user? This project has at its core a vault allowing anyone to deploy strategies with their desired fee: zero fee, 10%, etc., making free-to-use strategies entirely possible. However, we expect all strategies listed on our frontend to be curated and have some kind of fee. Will this project pay for any portion of the service? No. Will this project be open-source? Yes, the code will be public with an MIT license.
