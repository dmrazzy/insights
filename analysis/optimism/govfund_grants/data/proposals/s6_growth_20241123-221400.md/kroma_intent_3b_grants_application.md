# Market Analysis:

- **Please briefly answer all market analysis questions:** Specify the goals and objectives of the grants program, such as increasing TVL, launching new protocols, or attracting new users from specific categories

# Grant's impact

- **Please briefly answer all grant's impact questions:** We understand that we need to abide by the Collective Grant Policies, and that as an OP Chain receiving a grant we must: (1) make grants that follow the Collective Grant Policies (i.e., builder grants subject to a 1 year lockup, user incentive grants where grant recipients pass all tokens to end users, no-sale rule, etc.); and (2) not use our grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g., making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain).
- **Full list of the project’s labeled contracts:** Kroket will serve as a gateway for Web2 users in Asia to experience Superchain. The reward app model has already been well-proven in the Korean and Japanese markets. Kroma’s developer, Lightscale, is a Korea-based team led by founders with a strong track record of successfully launching multiple Web2 mobile apps in the region. By attracting a large number of Web2 users through Kroket and gradually introducing them to Web3, Kroma will contribute to achieving the holy grail of Web3 mass adoption. In the future, Kroket will expand its support for the entire Superchain, providing Web2 users a seamless entry point into even more Web3 experiences.

# Metrics improved by OP incentives

- **Select the metric specified in the mission request:** yes
- **Fill out your metric objective:** To ensure transparency and track the progress of each grantee, Kroma will maintain and regularly update a Google spreadsheet shared with the Optimism Collective. This spreadsheet will include details on all grantees, their key metrics, and milestone achievements.


Additionally, Kroma will provide retrospective reports on a regular basis, summarizing overall progress, challenges, and any necessary adjustments to the program. These reports will include insights into the retention of active users, dApp adoption rates, and the impact of the grants on the broader Superchain ecosystem.

# Budget and Plan

- **Please briefly answer all budget and plan questions:** The grant allocation framework will be modular, allowing for continuous improvement and adjustment based on market trends and Kroket’s objective to act as a funnel for bringing more users into Web3. The framework is designed to make the process efficient and transparent, ensuring that applicants understand their status and what is needed to progress. Tiered Grant System To ensure efficient allocation, Kroma will introduce a tiered grant system. Early-stage projects with no viable product will receive smaller grants, while projects with proven metrics and operational products will qualify for larger grants, based on their immediate contribution to Kroma and the Superchain ecosystem. Each grantee will be assigned an account manager from the Grants Council, who will relay the results of the internal assessment, negotiate milestones, and deliverables, and finalize the grant agreement. Grantees can opt to add additional milestones to qualify for higher-tier grants or proceed with the proposed grant amount based on the initial evaluation. Criteria for Grant Eligibility Projects with a proven or convincing blockchain model are eligible for grants, with the following exclusions: Projects related to pornography, gambling, drugs, violence, or other unethical content. Grantees pivoting to such verticals after receiving a grant will have their agreements terminated. Applications will be reviewed by the Decision Makers within one week, based on the following criteria: Contribution to Kroket or user experience enhancement. Authenticity of the business model and necessity of blockchain technology. Expected on-chain performance Target Metrics illustrated below.
