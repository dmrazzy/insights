","In the midst of the FIP0056 governance debates, the timely and accurate analysis from our research team played a pivotal role in providing an accurate analysis to evaluate claims being made about the proposed cryptoeconomic sector multiplier mechanism and to inform relevant stakeholders and the broader Filecoin community to navigate towards a resolution and prevent misinformation or misunderstandings. This includes:

-Reviewing the FIP-0056 and CDM debate (https://medium.com/block-science/reviewing-the-fip-0056-and-cdm-debate-on-filecoin-6a6af0ed4b78), as cited in governance forum discussions: a timely, scientific analysis at the height of the FIP-0056 and CDM governance debate, presented in the form of a blog post, to dispel misinformation and inform the community to be able to meaningfully participate in discussions, towards a viable path forward. This post received very positive feedback from the community and has been referenced in governance forum posts since. 

-Past work on educating about Termination Fee, as per ""Exploring the Filecoin Termination Fee"" (https://medium.com/block-science/exploring-the-filecoin-termination-fee-9351fd40340e - April 2023) was directly relevant to the governance discussions on the Termination Penalty (#691, #712 and #724 May to July 2023), which then evolved to the discussions related to improving Storage Reliability on Filecoin (#843, October 2023)

-Work on articulating and educating on the inner workings of the Baseline Minting and Consensus Pledge was important for the governance discussions on FIP-0081 (#847, Oct-Dec 2023), as per ""A cadCAD Interactive Calculator to Explore Minting Scenarios in Filecoin"" (https://medium.com/block-science/a-cadcad-interactive-calculator-to-explore-minting-scenarios-in-filecoin-284009a2e941 - Mar 2022).","These contributions to Filecoin governance were informed by years of dedicated research, analysis, and development, as well as a strong commitment to innovation, stability, and progress in Filecoin as a critical component of the digital commons.

This has allowed storage providers to manage data onboarding and retrieval more efficiently and flexibly.

1. New deal making protocol focused on using HTTP data transfer protocol for deal data transfer to replace the existing Graphsync protocol.

2. Booster-HTTP: This component operates as a HTTP gateway within the Boost setup. It facilitates the retrieval of data through HTTP protocols, enhancing the flexibility and accessibility for retrieving stored files. Notably, recent updates have moved towards a trustless gateway system, named Frisbii, which does not support the previous unixfs file format. Instead, users needing to handle unixfs formatted files are advised to run an additional binary known as bifrost-gateway. This shift ensures retrieval verifiability by default, aiming to boost the security and reliability of data transactions​​.

3. Booster-Bitswap: This component uses the Bitswap protocol, a block exchange protocol native to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). It plays a crucial role in connecting IPFS network with Filecoin network by allowing IPFS nodes to directly fetch the data from Filecoin network.

4. IPNI integration: Boost is the original data source for IPNI protocol. It allows SP to publish the list of CIDs they hold and retrieval mechanism which can be used to retrieve the data.
","Adoption and Network Growth: The Boost project has significantly impacted the Filecoin network by facilitating over 5500PiB of 
 peak Quality-Adjusted Power (QAP). This demonstrates substantial growth in storage capacity and effectiveness, ensuring that Filecoin's network becomes more robust and capable of handling large-scale data storage needs.

Enhanced Data Retrieval Capabilities: Boost has revolutionized the way data is retrieved from the Filecoin network by enabling the retrieval network to fetch data using various data transfer protocols. This flexibility allows for more efficient data handling and access, catering to a wider range of use cases and enhancing user experience.

New mk1.2.x Protocol: The introduction of the new mk1.2.x protocol as part of Boost’s framework has brought significant improvements in deal data transfer. These improvements enhanced the overall deal making experience for storage provider and client alike for the online deals.

DeFi Leaderboard,0x453ba9809d32752f773ec79024f00338c0babb169094cd17f56e33918a37daa4,"The introduction of smart contracts through the Filecoin Virtual Machine has introduced the concept of programmability to the Filecoin network. This new capability opens the door for sophisticated and advanced new applications. The steep economic cost of participating in reward mining has long stimulated a need for storage providers to seek additional support through external financing. Even though the FVM allows for transparency through contract verification, it is difficult to inspect or verify the capacity of a liquidity provider. 

Whereas solutions such as DeFillama depend on self-reported statistics which can be gamed, the DeFi Leaderboard is one of the very few projects to directly calculate liquidity flow through on-chain calculations. Starboard’s DeFi Leaderboard adds new verifiability and trust to the high economic stakes of liquidity provision. 

Stakeholders served by the DeFi Leaderboard include storage providers, individual investors, liquidity providers, blockchain analytics firms, and product/governance officials at Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Foundation. 
","Storage providers and individual investors in liquid staking pools have much at risk, as information about liquidity providers is often provided on a reported basis only, leaving users with no choice but to take reported figures at face value. To introduce an element of verifiability to liquidity provision, Starboard’s DeFi leaderboard offers an independent calculation of both deposits and borrowings from liquid staking pools directly from the blockchain. 

Blockchain analytics firms and product/governance teams at Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Foundation have a need to track the evolution of liquidity provision to the Filecoin network for both analytics and monitoring purposes. The DeFi Leaderboard satisfies this need, not only by tracking staking and borrowing activity, but also by tabulating these flows over time. We are thus able to tell periods of growth and decline in the overall DeFi landscape in Filecoin. 
","Storage providers and individual investors now have access to information about liquid staking pools which are independently verified at the individual transaction level, offering both lenders and borrowers assurance about the veracity of DeFi protocols’ lending activities. 

Analytics and governance teams from blockchain analytics companies and PL/FF have access to instant highlight figures tracking the growth of liquidity provision. Our figures are trusted and cited widely by groups such as Messari, or Filecoin TLDR. 

A notable example that has arisen recently is the unexpected legal troubles experienced by the stFIL protocol in April 2024. Starboard’s DeFi Leaderboard was able to track in real time flow of token out of the protocol over several days, and put the decline in the context of the broader DeFi landscape in the Filecoin ecosystem.

"drand: distributed, verifiable randomness ",0x3058eb34788aeec3a817d436969d13a9963314f4c9d201e766cbd84a126e8935,"Our distributed public randomness project, drand, is an open source project to create a threshold network able to provide developers with everything needed to achieve public verifiability and accountability of the randomness used in their software without having to care about the deep underlying cryptographic questions that need to be solved to do so.
Randomness is important in many applications and it is often useful to be able to prove it has been properly generated, with a ""nothing up my sleeve"" approach, just like lotteries typically do manual draws. The main goal of drand is to provide all the tooling required to use public randomness  (i.e. random values that are meant to be public) in a verifiable manner.

The League of Entropy and drand are being used by a variety of projects, from NGOs selecting their next UBI recipients in Sierra Leone, to leader election in Filecoin consensus mechanisms, to online gambling websites and blockchain smart contracts.

The ongoing maintenance and stewardship of drand as an open-source software is essential to guarantee continued access to verifiable randomness as a public good for everybody to use whenever they have a need for public randomness.","Thanks to drand stability and stewardship, the League of Entropy was able to operate with a 100% uptime during the entire period covered by this RetroPGF round, furthermore the drand maintainers have been operating 3 ""drand relays"" to guarantee that SPs can access the randomness produced by the League of Entropy with as little latency as possible, allowing them to start computing any required proofs as soon as they need to.","In the period covered by this RetroPGF round, the drand team have launched a new, faster network that allows stateless verification of drand beacons. This speeds up verification of randomness for SPs, reduces bandwidth requirements, reduces latency and reduces the required storage for drand beacons in block headers. This was proposed in FIP-63 but isn't live yet on Filecoin.

The relays operated by the team also provided over 7000 GB of low latency, high availability bandwidth to Filecoin SPs, serving over 2 billions requests from the Filecoin network in the period covered by this RetroPGF round.

Under normal operating conditions, it reduces the confirmation from several hours to ~15 minutes while maintaining the same level of security, greatly improving the UX for applications and the overall network. An accompanying implementation is available for use by any interested party.","The EC Finality Calculator consists of a theoretical analysis of EC finality (in the form of a technical report), a calculator specification and evaluation (in the form of a merged FRC), and a working prototype (as a stand-alone python implementation). This set of layered contributions enables participants to compute the reversal probabilities for any past tipset, and consequently consider transactions as final according to desired risk criteria.","Filecoin's Expected Consensus provides probabilistic finality and a 900-epoch soft finality threshold. Prior to the release of the EC Finality Calculator in Jan 2024, there was no rigorous way to determine the reversal probability of a given tipset/chain. Therefore, network participants like exchanges and L2 operators had no other option but to enforce a worst-case wait time of 100-900 epochs (i.e. hours) before clearing transactions or releasing funds.

Through a rigorous auditing and validation process, and comprehensive scoring system, these initiatives empower Storage Providers (SPs) to quantify and improve their environmental impact, while also fostering a culture of environmental responsibility across the network.","As a member of the Filecoin Green team, I developed the Energy Validation Process and Green Scores methodology. I also led it's implementation and validation to assist Storage Providers in decarbonizing operations based on verifiable claims. Lastly, I also authored articles to spread awareness of our work.","Impact: Our work stems from Filecoin Green, where we designed and successfully implemented the Energy Validation Process (EVP) and Green Scores Methodology across 250 minerIDs, and have a queue of more than 700 minerIDs. We have since spun out at Nova Energy to continue this critical work.

1. Validation and Recognition: The EVP offers SPs a pathway to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability through data-driven validation. By submitting detailed information on energy consumption, production, and eco-conscious practices, SPs not only receive recognition in the form of an audit output and sustainability claim but also pave the way for possible economic incentives tied to their Green Scores.

2. Holistic Impact Assessment: The Green Scores Methodology goes beyond simplistic metrics to provide a nuanced evaluation of SP’s environmental impact. By considering factors such as emissions intensity, location-specific effects on the power grid, and data integrity, this methodology offers a comprehensive assessment that reflects the complex realities of sustainable data storage and Storage Provider operations.

3. Incentivizing Sustainability: In the future, we intend to tie Green Scores to economic benefits, such as reputation score boosts and access to green financing opportunities, which will enable the EVP and Green Scores Methodology to incentivize SPs to prioritize sustainability. This will not only benefit individual SPs but also contribute to the broader goal of reducing the environmental impact and advancing Filecoin's commitment to a greener future.","['INFRASTRUCTURE', 'Other']",[],[],0,0,0,,,"[2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3]"

It acts as a deployment target for network builders in the Filecoin ecosystem looking for spare space, processing power or geo-diversity for their network. Station offers a wide variety of different nodes, from beefy servers to small desktop computers and Raspberry Pis, scattered across the globe.","Filecoin Network Health: The first use cases deployed to Station are all auxiliary networks and protocols for improving and growing the Filecoin Network, with the very first one being the Spark Protocol.

The Spark protocol is sampling retrievals from Filecoin Storage Providers for files stored through the FIL+ LDN program, aiming to measure, improve upon and then maintain a high retrieval success rate for the Filecoin Network. The Station network is the perfect fit for the Spark protocol as it offers a heterogeneous and geo-distributed set of nodes from which to make retrievals, ensuring that Storage Providers are not able to ascertain which clients are creating the sample traffic and which clients are creating the real traffic.

Web3 UX: The UX for new operators has been the top priority of the Station initiative. The UX for getting set up on Station is very straightforward and doesn't require technical chops. Operators often remark on how simple it is to get set up and start earning FIL. Whereas becoming a Storage Provider takes a lot of technical and financial clout and is a very serious undertaking, running a Filecoin Station node can be done by anyone with a computer, and it simply runs in the background. Once onboarded, new Station Operators have taken the first step towards learning and understanding more about the Filecoin Ecosystem.
","Between October 2023 and March 2024, Filecoin Station has onboarded a new group of people to help improve and maintain the Filecoin Network. Station has created/onboarded over 11k new Filecoin accounts to the Filecoin Network and has rewarded these account with over 2.5k FIL. This literally means over 11k new Filecoin network participants now have some FIL assigned to their wallet.

The Spark module running on Station is currently making 22M retrieval requests per day for around 65k new CIDs per day and measuring the Retrieval Success rate of Storage Providers.

HeartBit allows people to gift their time onchain, in a provable manner and with CIDs.

HeartBit started as an experiment to leverage IPFS as the connecting web for onchain social interactions. This led to the creation of an open SDK following the success of the HeartBit experiment on Farcaster and EthDenver.","The SDK is simple to use for both web2 and web3 developers, allowing them to add time-based, provable onchain and CID-based Likes & Minting to their dApp, website, onchain media, Frames, and more. For example, we stored a book on IPFS and all people reading it via Frame were minting HeartBits all pointing back to the book. 

The SDK now allows developers to quickly create a smart account-based Farcaster Frame or Lens Open Action which manages UserOps on behalf of people interacting with it (signless and gasless). One aspect that contributed to the success of HeartBit in the past months is that it is compatible with native crypto social media and leverages protocols like Safe and Hats. 

For example, at EthDenver we created a website to combine onchain and offchain experiences for people https://ethdenver.fileverse.io/ . Visitors were able to share the speaker profile of anyone speaking at EthDenver, in one click, as a Frame or Open Action. Every person interacting with the Frame/OpenAction could find IPFS-addressed content and mint HeartBits onchain with a hash pointing the HeartBit back to the actual content on IPFS.

One of Filliquid's distinguishing features is its permissionless nature. This allows borrowers, referred to as SPs (Storage Providers), to access $FIL liquidity without the need for traditional crypto or fiat collateral. Instead, they leverage their Beneficiary Address and future $FIL rewards from storage mining as collateral. This unique approach enables SPs to bolster their storage power without incurring additional financial burdens, fostering continuous expansion within the Filecoin ecosystem.

Moreover, Filliquid participants can optimize their earnings by farming $FIG, the platform's governance token. This incentivizes active engagement and contributes to the overall growth and sustainability of the Filliquid ecosystem.

Filliquid will officially launch the mainnet in Q2 2024, and we welcome the Filecoin ecosystem community to join this revolutionary decentralized platform!

During the 2023 ETH Global FVM Space Warp hackathon, FILLiquidity stood out among numerous DeFi projects and was awarded the DeFi Rockets recognition.","FILLiquid is a decentralized Filecoin-based borrowing and lending platform. We contribute to the Filecoin ecosystem, allowing $FIL holders to earn a yield on their holdings through a secure, decentralized, and audited lending infrastructure. At the same time, storage providers can come and use the $FIL previously pledged in their nodes as collateral to secure $FIL loans for the sole purpose of expanding their storage capacity. 

The ecosystem is designed to connect $FIL holders to storage providers, helping the latter experience reduced financial burdens for providing storage on the Filecoin network. 

Currently, storage providers are obligated to pledge $FIL to the network every time they expand storage or onboard new clients. Our contribution ensures that storage providers — one of the most integral components of the Filecoin ecosystem — may obtain $FIL without digging into their pockets for liquid assets by binding their miner nodes to the FILLiquid smart contract to serve as collateral. 

While the loan is outstanding, all future $FIL mining rewards are pledged to the smart contract, and the $FIL in the node is also pledged, providing security for lenders. In the case of a default, the $FIL pledged in the miner node can replenish the defaulted $FIL in the liquidity pool, keeping lenders safe.

The following are the contributions by FILLiquid to build the Filecoin Ecosystem.

Community
Actively supported the growth of Filecoin in Web 3.0 by growing the Filliquid community in Discord and Telegram:

https://linktr.ee/FILLiquid","FILLiquid’s impact will help secure the sustainable growth of the Filecoin storage capacity, allowing it to continue competing with the heavyweight centralized storage markets, such as Amazon W3. 

The pledging requirements for Filecoin storage providers present an opportunity cost between using funds for expanding storage hardware or obtaining $FIL to expand storage capacity. 

With AI systems presenting an ever-growing market for decentralized data storage services, Filecoin can be the leading provider as long as it can keep pace with AI models' expansive storage capacity needs.

While the pledging requirements might not burden storage providers at low token prices, the dilemma will become apparent as the $FIL token value rises and aquiring $FIL for pledging becomes more burdensome. 

Our solution allows storage providers to achieve both. They can use their liquid funds to buy hardware to expand their business capacity while using the previously pledged illiquid $FIL in their nodes as collateral to secure more $FIL to add more pledges and expand storage power.

This impact eases the financial burden for storage providers, expands storage power growth, and lets $FIL holders earn a yield. 
Overall, FILLiquid deepens the $FIL liquid available to storage providers, helping Filecoin to experience consistent and sustainable storage power growth over time.

The following is the impact that FILLiquid generated.

Forest is currently operating on Mainnet, Calibnet, and Butterflynet. We have successfully participated in the last three mainnet network upgrades without issue, as well as the upcoming NV22 on Calibnet. Performance and stability are good, however we continue to optimize and improve many components.

Overall the performance of Forest is a significant advantage over other implementations, requiring only a 4-core CPU and 16GB of RAM to perform even the most resource intensive operations. 

Snapshot generation and archival data export capabilities are two examples of Forest’s emerging potential. Through various optimizations, primarily on the storage layer (learn more:https://youtu.be/9PZbsF0ah64?si=6-wItLWXJXB7g_9g), Forest can generate snapshots on modest hardware and in less than half the time compared to Lotus. Similarly, exports of archival chain data have similar performance advantages and are half the size on disk with a slower growth rate over time.

Forest's snapshot and archival data export capabilities are actively being demonstrated through the Forest Snapshot & Archival Data service(https://forest.chainsafe.io/#snapshot-service). The service leverages Forest's significant performance benefits to generate snapshots and export archival data, which are made available for the community free of charge. This service is now the canonical source for snapshots for the entire network.

The RPC interface is a work in progress and will be a core focus for the coming months. Presently only a limited set of methods are implemented, largely due to the absence of a specification. The status of the RPC interface can be tracked in this project: https://github.com/orgs/ChainSafe/projects/29/. More information on the upcoming roadmap can be found here: https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/discussions/4220","- Established client diversity

The snapshot service has reliably generated and distributed snapshots with high uptime and availability. Through this service we have demonstrated Forest’s fantastic performance generating snapshots 3x faster on using 1/16th of the memory, compared to the now defunct service setup by Protocol Labs. In the last 30days this service has experienced zero incidents, a testament to the reliability of Forest and this service, and an uncommon experience for most Filecoin infrastructure operators. 

Our archival data service provides unlimited access to the full historical blockchain state in a manageable format. The initial data was sourced from Sentinel at a cost of ~$4000 USD, and is now available to the community free of charge. This service is hugely valuable in providing data availability to the network outside of the protocol, as it is presently very difficult to run full archival nodes and very few exist on the network today.

Funding the Commons,0x0199caad853c76c63bb74ce99e7b40a3bc61822270cab811f9801e6f0f8e1917,"With 9 international conferences since its inauguration in 2021, Funding the Commons is a referential event series across strategic markets for PGF innovation. FtC has also been organizing successful builder residencies, numerous public goods funding hackathons, as well select impact pilot projects leveraging the tools platformed across its ecosystem. 

Within the web3 ecosystem, FtC has established itself as the premier conference for PFG advancements, specifically targeting builders and innovators within the Filecoin and IPFS networks. 

By providing a platform for these individuals to showcase their work and connect with public goods funders, FtC has been instrumental in fostering collaborations and bringing to light the contributions of the Filecoin community to a broader audience. This initiative has bridged the gap between Filecoin and the wider public goods funding ecosystem, encompassing both web3 and web2 spaces, thereby facilitating an environment where ideas and methodologies for sustaining open-source projects can flourish and evolve. 

A pivotal aspect of Funding the Commons' dedication to supporting public goods builders is the creation of the [Builder Basic Income Fund on Drips](https://www.drips.network/app/drip-lists/36167722434539895740687283110259945938004377627588501179309095983175). This initiative serves as a concrete mechanism to offer continuous financial support to developers, allowing them to concentrate on adding value within open-source ecosystems without the burden of financial uncertainty. By ensuring a steady income for builders, Funding the Commons not only aids individual creators but also sets a new standard for public goods funding, encouraging other entities to adopt similar supportive measures.

Additionally, the launch of the Akashic project marks a significant milestone in Funding the Commons' efforts. This ambitious project aims to construct a digital archive of refugee stories on IPFS and Filecoin, safeguarding the memories, stories, and cultural heritage of refugees worldwide. Akashic's use of the decentralized and censorship-resistant properties of IPFS and Filecoin perfectly aligns with Filecoin's mission to offer a durable base for the preservation of human knowledge and history, ensuring these narratives remain immutable, accessible, and free from central oversight.

Since 2024, Funding the Commons has inherited Sustainable Blockchain Summit (SBS) and is now building on the legacy of this second conference series focused on exploring new models & mechanisms to better steward planetary commons.","FtC has achieved notable successes in enhancing the Filecoin ecosystem's visibility and operational capacity through strategic partnerships with key entities like Gitcoin and Optimism - these collaborations have been crucial in the operationalization of Filecoin's retroPGF, and have generated significant awareness within the Ethereum public goods community about Protocol Labs' contributions. 

Furthermore, FtC has acted as a crucial convening platform for various communities, including Hypercerts and DeSci, among others, that are actively building within the ecosystem. These efforts have not only spotlighted Filecoin's pivotal role in supporting public goods but also underscored the tangible impacts and contributions of Funding the Commons in propelling the Filecoin and IPFS ecosystems forward.

Part of FtC’s contribution as a convener is the relationship-facilitation between the PL & Filecoin ecosystem and other academic partners of FtC, including UC Berkeley and Stanford.

Beyond its own events, FtC serves as a recruitment mechanism for other Public Goods Funding events. Most recently, FtC was the anchor and catalyst for [LabWeek24](https://www.labweek.io/24-pg) held by Protocol Labs in the SF Bay Area. Building off of the FtC event planning, this allowed hundreds of attendees to Filecoin retroPGF events, DeSci, Blockchain Innovation Forum, [amongst many others](https://www.labweek.io/24-pg/schedule/calendar).

FtC team inherited SBS, a cherished conference initiated through Filecoin Green that platforms web3 sustainability initiatives and is growing it in a new form: Earth Commons. SBS was instrumental in showcasing projects and initiatives that demonstrated the potential of decentralized technologies, such as Filecoin and IPFS, in addressing environmental challenges. In 2024, FtC has already successfully built partnerships with other stakeholders, including Hyphen.Earth, Ma Earth, and Gain Forest, that are taking an increasing role in the co-production and stewardship of SBS into the future. We have already reached more people (digitally) in the past 90 days than SBS ever did, and we are in the process of significantly growing an engaged audience through this platform aimed at recruiting into the PGF conversation leveraging climate media tactics (see impact metrics below).","Funding the Commons has played a vital role in championing the development of the Filecoin and IPFS ecosystems through its robust support for public goods builders, cross-ecosystem collaborations, and pioneering initiatives like the Akashic archive. These endeavors highlight the organization's significant contributions to shaping the future of public goods funding and underscore its worthiness as a candidate for Filecoin's retroPGF round support.

FtC directly supported the production of other LabWeek events, such as WikiAI hackathon, Public Goods Funding dinner, CodeX Future Law @ Stanford Law School, and recruited speakers who spoke at various LabWeek events.

Part of our work in building and connecting the public goods funding ecosystem includes facilitating the interconnectivity of the Filecoin ecosystem with other public goods funding ecosystems, such Optimism retroPGF which inspired the current Filecoin retroPGF campaign. In this way, Funding the Commons contributes to influence Filecoin’s public goods funding landscape.

FVM Explorer,0x51bb451c7b53e50caa82b81078b2f0a6e085dbde8df1d9cc706ac03139c37ee2,"The introduction of smart contracts through the Filecoin Virtual Machine has introduced the concept of programmability to the Filecoin network. This new capability opens the door for sophisticated and advanced new applications. For example, FVM makes it possible to devise decentralised financing for Filecoin’s storage providers, executed through a wide variety of financing and business models. With the FVM comes the need to carefully scrutinise smart contracts and transactions as they are happening. Important stakeholders include developers of Web3 applications based on smart contracts, retail users of these applications, and engineering/production/governance teams on Filecoin who seek to track smart contract uptake and adoption. 

Starboard’s FVM Explorer is a true block explorer, providing live information about smart contracts and their associated transactions at the block level. FVM Explorer provides rankings of contracts according to user, activity, gas usage and other metrics, allowing users to understand the key smart contracts influencing the Filecoin VM. Finally, FVM Explorer includes a suite of utilities to allow tooling developers to verify their smart contracts through an API or through the Hardhat plugin. 
","A wide variety of stakeholders require access to detailed, low-latency and block level information about smart contract execution on the FVM. Stakeholders include Web3 app and tooling developers; regular users of said applications; and product, engineering and governance teams at Protocol Labs. 

Web3 app and tooling developers need to scrutinise events at a transactional and contract level to debug development tools and for validation and monitoring purposes. FVM Explorer addresses this need by providing low latency access to smart contract events. 

Web3 is a nascent frontier and a key obstacle to broader adoption is suspicion and a trust deficit. Therefore, the need to offer users reassurance about app functionality is a strong pain point for many app developers. FVM Explorer addresses this need by offering an extensive suite of tools to verify source code. In the period Oct 2023 to Mar 2024, Starboard has continued to boost FVM Explorer by adding a suite of contract verification tools (https://fvm.starboard.ventures/explorer/verifier) that allow users to confirm that a smart contract’s source code matches the deployed code byte for byte. This contract verification process provides confidence in the integrity of an application and promotes transparency among smart contracts in FVM. 

Regular users desire reassurance about what smart contracts are actually doing, particularly when large sums of token are at stake. FVM Explorer allows users the ability to directly inspect pre-verified source code and ABI of smart contracts, and establishes a source of truth for users to scrutinise individual smart contract transactions in granular detail. 
","Tooling developers and Web3 application developers have been able to obtain low latency access to smart contract events, allowing them to debug their smart contracts and applications. 

Regular users are now able to scrutinise smart contracts and their associated transactions.

The FVM team successfully launched the Wasm-based FVM hypervisor on Filecoin mainnet on July 6, 2022 (Skyr upgrade), bundled with Wasm-compiled built-in actors. The team subsequently subsequently launched the first FVM runtime —the Filecoin EVM— to mainnet on March 14, 2023 (Hygge upgrade).","During the evaluated period in this RPGF-1 round, the FVM team has significantly contributed to the Filecoin ecosystem and tech stack, demonstrating our commitment and delivering tangible results.

This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- Expanding the Filecoin developer community through strategic organization of hackathons, talks, and workshops, such as LabWeek'23, EthGlobal Istanbul, FIL Bangalore, EthIndia, Data Economy, Scaling Web3, EthLondon, ETHDenver, and more.
- Ensuring prompt and helpful developer support during events, as well as consistently on Slack.
- Collaborating with other teams to support the launch of AMM/DEXes on Filecoin mainnet.
- Delivering important features requested by ecosystem teams and developers, including: Eth API tracing, pluggable syscalls; as well as numerous improvements, cleanups, and fixes mainly in ref-fvm and Lotus.
- Landed various FVM-related FIPs in nv21: FIP-0071 (deterministic state access), FIP-0072 (event syscall API), FIP-0073 (remove beneficiary from self_destruct syscall), FIP-0075 (improvements to FVM randomness syscalls).
- Rapidly reviewing and addressing FVM-related security reports.
- Establishing FRC standards for data aggregators, programmatic deals, on-chain payment channels, etc., spearheading community discussion, and collaborating with key teams like Lighthouse and Spheron for adoption.
- Thoroughly analyzing FEVM painpoints reported by stakeholders (e.g. addressing), and proposing effective solutions (or lack thereof).
- Driving RaaS implementations, crafting RaaS documentation, and showcasing RaaS functionality on calibrationnet and mainnet.
- Reviewing and addressing changes in the Filecoin EVM to preserve compatibility with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade.
- Regularly updating developer tools and frameworks (e.g. Hardhat and Foundry templates) and enhancing documentation like the FVM Cookbook and docs.filecoin.io.
- Maintaining the filecoin-solidity library, a critical dependency of every Filecoin-specific FEVM application, evolving it from its initial PoC stage into a more robust, production-ready version used by most FIL apps.
- Diligently monitoring and publicly reporting metrics, including on-chain stats, DeFi metrics, programmatic storage deals.
- Working closely with the IPC team to enable the scalability framework to anchor onto the Filecoin L1 through Solidity smart contracts.

The merger of the FVM team at EngRes / PLGO with the IPC team in late Q4'23 has significantly amplified the joint impact, enabling IPC to play a key role in realizing step 3 of the Filecoin master vision: bringing services and compute to the vast amounts of data stored in the Filecoin network.

Thanks to IPC, teams working on distributed compute, indexing, reputation, ingestion, retrieval, etc. can now launch their own decentralized networks on Filecoin, backed by custom cryptoeconomics.

Key contributions of the joint FVM/IPC team include:
- Delivering the IPC M2.5 milestone (Fendermint client with CometBFT consensus, anchored on the Filecoin L1 through EVM smart contracts).
- Implementing essential features requested by the first L2 subnets (federated validation, ERC20 token supply networks, General Message Passing, atomic deposits from foreign L1s via Axelar).
- Closely collaborating with the first IPC-powered compute network, Fluence, to enable and support their launch on Filecoin mainnet on March 20, 2024.
- Attracting and engaging a new cohort of hackers interested in blockchain scaling via hackathons like ETHDenver, ETHOxford, EthGlobal London, and more.","This section states the impact of the FVM as a core technology.

","1) 🌐 Glif Nodes offers publicly available API service with over 99.95% of availability with over 230,000 unique IP addresses sending over 4 billion requests per month.

❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify: 

It is a service similar to a highly reliable public library that's open almost all the time—virtually 24/7—where over 230,000 people from different places visit monthly. 

Imagine each visitor using the library more than once, amounting to over 4 billion requests for books every month. 

Just as a library serves its community by providing free access to knowledge, Glif API nodes provide crucial data and services to users of the Filecoin network. Glif nodes' near-perfect availability ensures that anyone relying Filecoin's digital 'library' can access the information they need anytime, without interruptions, making Glif service a dependable and essential resource for the community.

🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: Filecoin Network users who want to e.g. make the transactions or connect the Metamask; dApps; The Filecoin Core Team. All those groups use the nodes that we are running.

2) ✅ Glif Node provides a CID Checker - a tool to check any CID in the network.

❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify:
CID Checker works much like a tracking system for packages. In the digital world of the Filecoin network, where files and information are sent and stored across a decentralized system, each piece of content is given a unique label, known as a CID (Content Identifier). 

This label helps to track and locate specific pieces of content within the network, just like a postal tracking number allows you to see where your package is and when it will arrive. The CID Checker allows anyone to enter this unique label and find out where the content is stored and how it can be accessed. It's a user-friendly tool that ensures transparency and accessibility, helping users feel confident and informed about where their data is held in the vast digital space.

7) 🛠️ Glif Nodes supplies several essential software components for developers in a ready-to-use form - Docker images, Infrastructure-as-Code tool and Helm charts.

❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify: 

We supply several essential software components for developers much like how a pre-assembled furniture kit makes it easy to set up a bookshelf without needing to understand carpentry. These software 'kits' help various organizations within the Filecoin network easily build and manage their systems, enhancing efficiency and accessibility. 

📋 Examples of such services delivered by Glif Nodes to Filecoin community are: 

a) Filecoin Docker images that are nowadays just as popular as the Docker images supported by the Filecoin core team; they help developers to quickly spin up their own nodes on the Filecoin network. Devs just need to download the image and run it. 
b) The Filecoin-IaC tool that allows reducing efforts for users who are willing to spin up thousands of Filecoin nodes. Without the tool they would have to repeat this process thousand times scaling the process 
c) The Filecoin-chart tool that does same thing as Filecoin-IaC but over Kubernetes

The streaming nature of the tooling means it has very low memory overhead (tens of MBs) -- this allows for deployment in hardware-constrained environments.,"This is a first of its kind streaming tool that does everything related to data preparation, i.e. all that is required until just before deal making. It generates CAR files in a streaming fashion maintaining a fairly small memory footprint without compromising on(in fact in a lot of cases increasing) the throughput. It also provides functionality to split large CAR files into smaller CAR files to ensure that the whole IPLD dag is maintained intact but at the same time CAR file sizes are small enough to fit into a sector.","This has been the main tool used by two high-visibility projects to prepare data to be onboarded to filecoin.
Internet Archive -- Internet Archive runs their own data preparation on commodity hardware. As a result they often ran into issues such as aborted jobs due to insufficient memory. go-fil-dataprep solved this problem by significantly reducing the memory footprint, and at the same time also increased the throughput significantly. Secondly, the CAR-splitting functionality of go-fil-dataprep allowed for handling of files with size larger than sector size (32G/64G) without requiring splitting of the IPLD dag. By not splitting the DAG by external tools, we enabled streaming retrievals, for example for large movie archives.
Triton (Solana RPC provider) -- The Solana collaboration with Filecoin has gained a lot of visibility recently. Triton took the lead in archiving Solana ledger data to Filecoin. The CAR files Triton was producing for each Solana epoch -- which is roughly a few hundred GBs in size today.

A key property of a Prolly tree that enables fast diff and structural sharing is history independence. No matter which order you insert, update, or delete values, the Prolly tree is the same. 

Fast Diff
Given history independence, the Prolly Tree difference calculation becomes quite simple. If the hash of the root chunk is the same the entire subtree is the same. Thus, one must just walk the tree down to the leaves, ignoring hashes that are equal. Hashes that are different represent the difference.

Structural Sharing
Recall that Prolly trees are stored in a content addressed block store where the content address forms the lookup key for the block.
Thus, any blocks that share the same content address are only stored in the block store once. When they need to be retrieved they are retrieved via content address. This means that any blocks shared across versions will only be in the block store once.",['TOOLING'],['kenlabs/go-ipld-prolly-trees'],['kenlabs/go-ipld-prolly-trees'],1,0,11,2022-11-25 17:11:23.000000 UTC,2023-11-01 12:02:44.000000 UTC,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]"

https://blog.mauve.moe/posts/peer-to-peer-databases","Peer to peer and decentralized applications have been popular lately, but almost all of them rely on synchronizing append only logs of operations (or an equivalent). This leads to performance degredation over time as data accumulates and needs to be processed on new peers before they can start querying and updating data within an existing swarm. This post will talk about how pre-indexed peer to peer databases can be built and how they can sidestep the need to process operation logs and query data more efficiently. The short of it is that with this new data structure, the network becomes your database instead of needing to build a database after loading everything from the network.

P2P Social Apps
A lot of social P2P apps right now use the append only logs method of synchronizing data and end up having large histories if they actually get used for a long period of time. Generally these apps also have users coming in and out from the swarm frequently and being offline for long periods of time. This leads users to commonly face the downsides of using append only logs. New users have to sit and wait for their databases to sync (sometimes for minutes, sometimes tens of minutes), and users that haven't been online for a while can still need to sit around a bit to get up to speed. Very active users that might be in a bunch of chatrooms at once will have that initial load multiplied by each chat they're participating in which can lead to sluggishness (see Matrix chat clients when you're in hundreds of rooms with thousands of people).

If these apps instead used p2p databases, they could drastically improve the initial load times. Instead of waiting for all of the history to sync, a client can focus on getting the set of most recently active users, and query their indexes for just the messages that are needed to render the current view. Detecting notifications like mentions or ""new messages"" can also be done by comparing your last seen state of somebody's index with the latest one. The app can then pull just the notifications since the last load (or last ""marked read"") or ignore those indexes entirely if a user has notifications turned off for that channel.

Once the intial load is in place and a user is set up to see the latest data, their client can then start slowly backing up more messages from peers to populat a chat history and help improve replication if the user wants their client to keep more messages available for offline use. In fact, using indexes within your data gives applications fine grained control over what data they do or don't want to have available locally.

Depending on how you structure your post verification, you can make use of the prolly tree merging to combine users indexes togehter and perform searches accross the entire DB keyspace at once. This can simplify a lot of the code for querying data for views, but it comes with the tradeoff that you'll need to build more trust into your system so that users can't pretend to author posts on behalf of others. Generally you'll need to use public key cryptography to ""sign"" posts in addition to their data in order to verify the author's identity.

In general, developers can now use similar approaches to talking to ""backend"" databases, but skip having to actually set one up and pay for the maintenance that it requires.

This is also where encrypted DAGs would come in handy. If you want to have private groups or DMs, the easiest way to represent them is to have separate encrypted prolly trees and tie the users identity to whatever ones they're participating in.

There's also room to explore peer discovery around things like ""tags"" that people are talking about and to figure out how to send a message to somebody that isn't already aware of your existence on the network. I've written about this in the past with my P2P Inboxes post, and some of the tutorials I did using ""gossip protocols"".

Overall, changing how peer to peer apps can exchange and merge data can give us some clear wins on user onboarding and on performance in general.


Blockchain State
Personally, I'm not a huge fan of blockchain based technology. And one of the main reasons for that is just how many resources you need to get a chain running, and the centralizing effect that has on the network. In order to run a (even a proof of stake based) full node you typically need hundreds of GBs of harddisk storage, a whole bunch of RAM, and a bunch of CPU power spinning away. And once you have one, it needs to take a while to catch up with the chain, or use snapshots to catch up and keep going. This means that setting up full nodes isn't something the average person will be able to do and leads to groups with more spare capital or technical knowledge to set them up. For everyone else, they need to rely on other people's full nodes in order to query the blockchain state or post transactions (with exceptions that I'm not going to get into here).

As a result, most ""clients"" trying to use blockchains have to trust that the full node they're using isn't omitting data, and that it will be online fot them indefinitely. These full nodes typically keep a local database (like postgres or the such) and have an HTTP API for clients to connect to and ask for state. This HTTP API is where full nodes can impose arbitrary restrictions and start charing for access to the chain state. For example, if you're trying to use metamask to access some data, or some NFT platform, they effectively control your access to the chain via their centralized management of these HTTP APIs.

With p2p databases, we can sidestep the need for these HTTP APIs and central-ish databases in blockchain ecosystems. Instead of a blockchain existing to keep an append only log of blocks, and full nodes acting as indexers over that state in order to make it actually usable, what if the chain published both the latest block, and a link to the root of a Prolly Tree containing the indexes of all the data.

From there a client could talk to any node participating in keeping the chain running and do their actual query on the data by traversing the peer to peer indexes. Instead of loading everything from a single node and depending on it to be online, a client can load subsets of the index from multiple nodes in paralell, and the more nodes exist in the chain the more available the data will be.

This can also be used to ""prove"" that a certain result was part of the blockchain state by linking to the root block, and the subset of the prolly tree which was used to satisfy the query. From there one could send these proofs around to different systems which can have implications for inter-chain communication and sending proofs without needing to be fully connected to the chain.

Backups and fresh starts can also be improved in that a node can get the latest block from the chain and start loading the underlying prolly trees from the history while prioritizing blocks that are relevant to any smart contract calculations first. To be specific, a node can execute code that relies on the state before having a full copy of the state by being able to load the part of the prolly tree it needs on the fly from the rest of the network.

Storage of the blockchain state can also be optimized thanks to the content addressibility. If only a small subset of the index changed, then all the other nodes in the tree will remain the same. It's kind of like compressing your DB right from the get go without losing the ability to roll back to earlier snapshots of your state.

To start, I'm hoping to work with the Filecoin FVM team to see if we can integrate Prolly Trees into their stack, and I'm likely going to reach out to some of the folks in the Cosmos Network via my collaboration with the Hypha worker cooperative.

Hopefully this has given you a bit of insight into how we can change the state of blockchain state (ha!). We can have new networks that are less dependent on central DBs, and therefore more resilient to outages and censorship. And we can make chains more efficient to participate in and search through.


Cross-Organizational Search
Another place where p2p search indexes would be useful is for indexing institutional data for text search. Specifically, it could be useful for projects doing archiving of data using WebRecorder to build up large datasets of crawled data. At the moment, it's possible to index data from these sources using traditional centralized databases like Elasticsearch, but this requires running centralized infrastructure and doesn't allow for sharing indexes between groups easily. Often this is done via external companies like Google which come in and set up search indexing on the institutions behalf and results in the institution relying on paying the third party to keep access to their own data.

With p2p databases we can begin to build up search indexes collaboratively with community members, where individuals or smaller groups can participate in generating indexed data, and larger indexes being formed from combining the smaller ones. For example, cultural institutions can start tracking data for use by their community, and they can also build bridges to other institutions in order to search through larger amounts of data without needing to delegate authority and ownership to a third party like Google.

This can apply outside of cultural institutions as well and can be used for curated search indexes for all sorts of use cases. Communities interested in a given topic can collaborate on search via prolly trees, scientific publishers and communities can combine their data, etc. Instead of having a centralized search engine like Google or Bing which is vulnerable to spam originating from untrusted and illrelevant parties, we can have smaller scale and more focused search indexes wich can be use and combined together based on who is interested in what. This is some of the paths that we're hoping to explore with the IPFS Search team by taking their existing indexed data and finding ways to ingest it into prolly trees and perform searches over top.

Big Data
Another place I'm excited to explore with p2p databases is the world of ""big data"". At the moment people are coordinateing large cloud deployments to process and send data around. Usually, due to the amount of central coordination necessary for making ""big data"" viable, this is all mediated through a central authority which controls access and exchange of data on their network.

Ingtroducing p2p databases into the mix gives us new ways of approaching big data. In the first place it gives us a new way to scale out and shard large datasets accross multiple storage backends by storing subsets of a prolly tree accross several machines. Decoupling the storage from the authoring and reading layer can make it possible to spin up different components within a single cloud or accross people's home machines. Ingestion can be completely changed too in that instead of running ingestion on a single database or via some sort of map reduce cluster, one can split up sections of data to be ingested and indexed and combine the outputted prolly trees at a different layer accross many worker nodes.

Apart from scaling we can now have new ways of structuring data marketplaces where authors of datasets can encrypt prolly trees and sell decryption keys to others which can then process and refine the data and publish it themselves. This sale and publishing can either be done via centralized marketplaces, blockchains, or manually coordinated contracts accross organiations. In fact, having the underlying distribution and processing be decentralized can be a boon to making Data DAOs which manage and profit off of datasets.

One project I'm working with at the moment is Pando from KEN Labs which is planning on being an out of the box solution to aggregating and working with large p2p datasets. At the moment we don't have clear use cases to point to, but we'll be optimizing different prolly tree configurations and working with other groups in order to find the best settings for read and write performance as well as distributed ingestion pipelines.",['TOOLING'],['rangermauve/ipld-prolly-indexer'],['rangermauve/ipld-prolly-indexer'],1,0,18,2023-11-01 22:07:50.000000 UTC,2024-05-15 19:14:28.000000 UTC,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

In production systems with machine learning components, updates and experiments are frequent. New updates to models(data products) may be released every day or every few minutes, and different users may see the results of different models as part of A/B experiments or canary releases.

1. Version Everything: Data scientists are often criticized for being less disciplined with versioning their experiments(versioning of data, pipeline, code, and models), especially when using computational notebooks.

2. Track Data Provenance: This applies to all processing steps in an AI/ML pipeline, including data collection/acquisition, data merging, data cleaning, feature extraction, learning, or deployment.

3. Reproducibility: A final question of AI/ML that is often relevant for debugging, audits, and also science more broadly is to what degree data, models, and decisions can be reproduced.
","JiaoZiFS's versatility shines across different industries – making it the multi-purpose tool for the data centric applications and teams.

1. Defining artificial intelligence in the context of lineage: Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that covers a variety of techniques and approaches that make it possible for machines to learn, adjust and act with intelligence comparable to the natural intelligence of humans. Lineage has direct implications for many of the techniques and approaches of AI, such as:


1.1 Neural networks. AI classifies data to make predictions and decisions in much the same way a human brain does. A neural network is a computing system made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that process data from external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The neural network requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data. Neural networks benefit greatly from the movement aspects of data lineage – because connecting those dots directs its search for meaning.

1.2 Natural language processing. AI that enables interaction, understanding and communication between humans and machines by analyzing and generating human language, including speech, is called natural language processing (NLP). NLP allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks. Natural language processing relies heavily on the human language data descriptions provided by the characteristics aspect of data lineage.

1.3 Machine learning. AI that’s focused on giving machines access to data and letting them learn for themselves is known as machine learning. Machine learning automates analytical model building using methods from neural networks, statistics, operations research and physics – and it finds hidden insights in data without being explicitly programmed where to look or what to conclude. Machine learning delves into the relationships, processes and transformations aspects of data lineage during its undirected exploration of data’s potential.

1.4 Deep learning. With deep learning, AI uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data and perform humanlike tasks, such as recognizing speech or understanding images and videos (also known as computer vision). This method takes advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques. Deep learning depends on the users’ aspect of data lineage because its education is guided by analyzing how users interact with data.

2 Solving the Mysteries of Data Science’s Past and Present with Data Lineage: Data lineage is an essential aspect of data science and data analytics that enables organizations to understand the journey of data from its origin to its destination. It is a process of tracking the origin, movement, and transformation of data through various stages of its lifecycle. Data lineage plays a critical role in enhancing the performance and productivity of data science and analytics teams.

2.1  By establishing a clear data lineage, data scientists and analysts can easily identify the source of data, its quality, and its dependencies. This information is crucial in ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and consistency. Additionally, data lineage helps teams quickly identify errors or issues in the data processing pipeline, enabling them to take corrective action promptly.
Moreover, data lineage promotes better collaboration among team members by providing a shared understanding of the data ecosystem. This shared understanding ensures that everyone involved in the data analysis process is on the same page, reducing confusion and errors caused by miscommunication.

2.2  Enterprise DataHub & Data Collaboration: Depending on your operating scale, you may even be managing multiple team members, who may be spread across different locations. JiaoZiFS enable Collaborative Datasets Version Management at Scale,Share & collaborate easily: Instantly share insights and co-edit with your team.

3 DataOps & Data Products & Data Mesh: Augmenting Enterprise Data Development and Operations,JiaoZiFS ensures Responsible DataOps/AIOps/MLOps by improving Data Versioning, Provenance, and Reproducibility. JiaoziFS makes a fusion of data science and product development and allows data to be containerized into shareable, tradeable, and trackable assets(data products or data NFTs). Versioning data products in a maturing Data Mesh environment via standard processes, data consumers can be informed about both breaking and non-breaking changes in a data product, as well as retirement of data products.

4 Industrial Digital Twin: Developing digital twins for manufacturing involves managing tons of large files and multiple iterations of a project. All of the data collected and created in the digital twin process (and there is a lot of it) needs to be managed carefully. JiaoziFS allows you to manage changes to files over time and store these modifications in a database.

5 Data Lake Management: Data lakes are dynamic. New files and new versions of ex- isting files enter the lake at the ingestion stage. Additionally, extractors can evolve over time and generate new versions of raw data. As a result, data lake versioning is a cross-cutting concern across all stages of a data lake. Of course vanilla distributed file systems are not adequate for versioning-related operations. For example, simply storing all versions may be too costly for large datasets, and without a good version manager, just using filenames to track versions can be error-prone. In a data lake, for which there are usually many users, it is even more important to clearly maintain correct versions being used and evolving across different users. Furthermore, as the number of versions increases, efficiently and cost-effectively providing storage and retrieval of versions is going to be an important feature of a successful data lake system.","1.

Mount Protocol,0xa5fe2de856b91b83552ea6fcfbfc776fc12e2bc984d53be0b4d13f97597ebfe3,"We’re developing Mount, an Filecoin protocol that establishes DataDAO with algorithmically set interest rates in the way of friend.tech ; users and dApps will be able to earn interest on FIL and tokens, and borrow Ether and tokens to invest, use, or short-sell.

The Mount protocol is a set of rules and procedures that govern the creation, issuance, and management of assets within the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on data management and governance.

Asset Creation: The protocol outlines the process for creating new assets within the Data DAO. This may include data tokens, data shares, or other digital assets that represent ownership or access rights to data within the DAO.

Issuance: The protocol defines the rules for issuing new assets to members of the DAO. This may involve a token sale, airdrop, or other distribution methods, and will include guidelines for determining the quantity and distribution of new assets.

Governance: The protocol establishes the governance structure for managing and making decisions about the assets within the Data DAO. This may include voting mechanisms, decision-making processes, and rules for modifying or updating the protocol itself.

Compliance: The protocol ensures that all asset creation, issuance, and governance activities are compliant with relevant regulations and best practices. This may involve legal review, compliance checks, and ongoing monitoring of asset activities.

Transparency: The protocol requires that all asset creation, issuance, and governance activities are transparent and accessible to all members of the Data DAO. This may include public records, open meetings, and regular reporting on asset activities.

Overall, the Asset Creation, Issuance, and Governance Protocol for Data DAO is designed to ensure that the creation and management of assets within the DAO are fair, transparent, and compliant with relevant regulations. By following these rules and procedures, the Data DAO can effectively manage and govern its assets to achieve its goals of data management and governance.","The concept of the Data DAO Protocol, as described, involves tokenizing social interactions related to data supply and consumption within the framework of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This approach integrates the principles of decentralized governance, tokenization, and social interactions to create a framework for managing data assets within a DAO. Here are some key aspects and potential implications of this concept:

1. Tokenized Social Interactions: By tokenizing social interactions, the Data DAO Protocol can create a system where participants are incentivized and rewarded for contributing, supplying, consuming, or interacting with data within the DAO ecosystem. Tokens can be used to represent ownership, access rights, or contributions to the data assets, and can serve as a means of incentivizing and aligning the interests of participants.

2. Data Supply and Consumption Interactions: The protocol can facilitate the exchange and utilization of data assets within the DAO, enabling participants to supply, consume, and interact with data in a tokenized and incentivized manner. This can include mechanisms for data sharing, data access, data analysis, and other forms of data-related interactions within the DAO ecosystem.

3. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): By operating within the context of a DAO, the protocol leverages decentralized governance mechanisms to manage and govern data-related activities. This can involve decentralized decision-making, voting mechanisms, and community-driven governance processes for managing data assets, protocols, and incentives within the DAO.

4. Incentivizing Data Contributions and Quality: Tokenized social interactions can be used to incentivize high-quality data contributions, data curation, and data-related activities within the DAO. By aligning incentives with the quality and value of data assets, the protocol can encourage participants to contribute and maintain high-quality data resources within the ecosystem.

5. Community-Driven Data Governance: The protocol can enable community-driven governance of data assets, allowing participants to collectively determine the rules, protocols, and incentives governing data supply, consumption, and interactions. This can foster a sense of ownership and participation among DAO members and align the governance processes with the interests of the community.

Overall, the Data DAO Protocol's approach to tokenized social interactions for data supply and consumption interactions within a DAO represents a novel way of managing and incentivizing data-related activities. By integrating tokenization, social interactions, and decentralized governance, the protocol aims to create a framework for sustainable and community-driven management of data assets within a decentralized ecosystem.

A particular challenge in the Filecoin ecosystem is the sheer volume of information to make sense of: apart from blockchain level data, Filecoin also generates information at token, application and service levels. This information is needed by a wide variety of stakeholders, including storage providers, data clients, as well as developers at Protocol Labs and the Filecoin foundation. Since Filecoin is decentralised and collectively governed, a rigorous and holistic grasp of network health and dynamics is urgently required. 

Starboard’s Network Health Dashboard provides the Filecoin ecosystem with a series of digestible, rigorous and informative breakdowns of the Filecoin protocol at the chain, token and service levels. We crunch and aggregate data from granular level up to distill insights into the health and state of the Filecoin network, aiding informed decision-making in the Filecoin ecosystem. 
","Storage providers need to rigorously calculate initial and ongoing costs and/or ROI of onboarding storage on the network. Blockchain analytics and teams such as the Filecoin TLDR team would like to disseminate digestible and yet accurate metrics to the general public. Product and business development teams in Protocol Labs or Filecoin Foundation have an urgent need to monitor uptake of new network initiatives (e.g. FVM), consequences of network upgrades, etc. Finally, multiple stakeholders involved in the collective governance of Filecoin need access to rigorous information about the network’s trajectory over time in order to make informed decisions about the future directions of the protocol.

All of these needs have a common pain point: each stakeholder depends on the availability of distilled information that is either difficult to access or non-trivial to calculate. Starboard addresses these issues by calculating metrics important to our stakeholders from first principles, for example, calculating network storage metrics from a sector-by-sector level upward. 
","Starboard’s Network Health Dashboard has contributed significantly to the Filecoin ecosystem. 

A source of truth for the general public. Analytics teams such as Messari, Filecoin TLDR team, as well as Filecoin’s social media accounts rely on Starboard’s metrics to provide digestible insights and primers into the Filecoin ecosystem. The reach of information provided by Starboard is considerable, as it is propagated widely by our stakeholders on social media, on research/investor reports, and at international conferences. 

Monitoring of network initiatives. Starboard’s Network Health Dashboard is continually updated to give users up-to-date information about new initiatives in the network. Our new Filecoin Virtual Machine section gives users a precise picture of adoption of smart contract use and uptake. Our dashboards are also scrutinised by product and engineering leaders in Protocol Labs for continuous monitoring, for example, to compare how specific costs and gas usage evolve before and after network upgrades. 

Network governance. In Filecoin, different stakeholders jointly participate in network governance. These parties rely on Starboard’s metrics to inform their decision-making, as can be seen in the ubiquitous appearance of Starboard’s statistics, charts and metrics in FIP discussions, Slack chats and more.

Pando,0xacd66876c0aeb6d467f679d267dc27a7ac679f869da7a99dffe079ecefdcc0e7,"There are a number of emerging streams of data, including testing of miners by dealbots, reputation services, availability and demand for data, which while not directly hashed or part of the filecoin chain are foreseen as important to keep associated and available for the ongoing health of the network. The historic state of these data streams are useful for comparative analysis and understanding of the dynamics of the network, and deserve to both be preserved, and made available.

The Pando sidechain metadata service takes these streams of data, aggregates them into CAR archives, backs them up to filecoin, and provides a lightweight query interface for consumers to read specific points of metadata with higher assurance of their global consistency and veracity.
","There are several mechanisms we directly foresee being used for incentivization feedback loops based around the metadata measurements of entities in the filecoin ecosystem. For instance, reports of miner behavior can be used by reputation systems ranking miners, which then are used by clients to select higher quality miners near them. This data doesn’t make sense to directly embed within the filecoin chain for a few reasons: It is produced by independent entities, so the data itself does not need to meet the same ‘consensus’ bar as what we would expect in a global chain, and likewise aspects of reputation and measurements may have aspects of subjectivity. It is also expected that there is diversity of data and that experimentation is a good thing.

However, there are nice properties of having this sort of metadata ecosystem more tightly linked to the chain that seem desirable to encourage, and this leads to the goals for the sidechain metadata service:
1. Keep included metadata consistently available
2. Provide light-weight, unbiased access to metadata
3. Discourage historical revisionism.

----
There are two main types of impact for Public Good Crypto

**Solving hard problems**
A research entity can solve problems that can’t be solved by simply by more engineering.

We have seen this several time in Filecoin, to name a few: the design of the first practical PoRep came from a research grant to Ben Fisch (this led to making Filecoin practical), the design of SnarkPack came from Anca (this allowed for exabyte scaling network), the security analysis of PoRep which led to tighter bounds came from Leo (this increased our confidence in the lifetime of our sectors to several more years). This can be done both via grants and by hiring some of the best researchers full time.

**Aligning researchers**
The best way to scale a research team is to align the research community on our problems.

It can be hard for researchers to understand how a generic solution can have an impact on a specific problem in Filecoin; translating Filecoin specific needs in problem definitions that can be attractive to the research community can help us engage with a larger audience.

We have seen this several times in Filecoin: the need for faster SNARKs and our original RFC led to the design of Plonk (one of the most used SNARK alongside Groth16, STARKs and Halo), several teams writing improvements on PoRep (Leo’s latest paper, Ari Juel’s proof of incompressable proof) and our vector commitments are leading to major improvements in SNARKs (Lasso, CQ).

More importantly, we have seen that funding focused research teams (even with small grants) has led to very meaningful collaborations (e.g. work on tighter bounds of the existing PoRep).","* CryptoNet team has published several academic papers (Plonk, Testudo, Snarkpack, Caulk) that are widely used or have inspired new development in SNARK research
* CryptoNet team has solved important protocol research open questions and run theory audits for most protocols
* CryptoNet keeps active a community of over 50 researchers (https://cryptonet.org/about)

The Filecoin protocol is decentralised, community-driven and multi-stakeholder in nature. A particular challenge in the Filecoin ecosystem is the sheer volume of information to make sense of: apart from blockchain level data, Filecoin also generates information at token, application and service levels. This information is needed by a wide variety of stakeholders, including storage providers, product/business development teams at Protocol Labs and the Filecoin foundation, and tooling developers in the ecosystem. For maximal impact, our stakeholders often require this information provisioned on demand, for regular monitoring purposes or as part of more complex Web3 applications. 

Spacescope is Starboard’s API service, bringing composable analytics to the Filecoin ecosystem. Spacescope provides the same rigorous analytics and authoritative data that the community has come to expect from Starboard’s Network Health Dashboard. The provisioned data covers all aspects of the Filecoin ecosystem, from storage providers, to deal making and token circulation. 
","Storage providers need to rigorously calculate initial and ongoing costs and/or ROI of onboarding storage on the network. Blockchain analytics and teams such as the Filecoin TLDR team would like to disseminate digestible and yet accurate metrics to the general public. Product and business development teams in Protocol Labs or Filecoin Foundation have an urgent need to monitor uptake of new network initiatives (e.g. FVM), consequences of network upgrades, etc. Finally, multiple stakeholders involved in the collective governance of Filecoin need access to rigorous information about the network’s trajectory over time in order to make informed decisions about the future directions of the protocol.

Tooling developers such as Web3 application developers require up-to-date information about the Filecoin network to inform execution or logic of Web3 applications. Storage providers or individual contributors would like to obtain information about the Filecoin network for their own internal monitoring or internal dashboards. In these contexts, a common pain point is a need to obtain vital information with low latency and with minimal overhead. 
","Tooling developers and Web3 application developers rely on Spacescope to provide accurate current information about the Filecoin network as part of their apps’ operation logic e.g. to trigger specific logic or to optimize cost.

Research projects such as CryptoEconLab’s MechaFIL project use Spacescope as the underlying data source for sophisticated forecasting of the Filecoin circulating supply.

The Filecoin core Protocol does not have a way to check that Storage Providers are making CIDs from the set of FIL+ LDN deals available for hot retrieval, despite it being a condition for storing FIL+ deals. Spark aims to solve this. It samples the list of such CIDs, looks them up in IPNI and then makes retrieval requests to those files and reports on the results.

To make sure that Storage Providers are unaware of which clients are making Spark retrievals, Spark uses the Station network of globally distributed devices to act as the clients.

Between October 2023 and March 2024, the number of (Station) nodes running Spark requests went from essentially 0 to ranging between 10k and 20k daily. Spark is now making around 20m retrieval requests a day to Filecoin Storage Providers and it is requesting roughly half a million different file CIDs each week.

In March, the Spark protocol added the ability to calculate retrieval success rate by Storage Provider, by linking up keys in IPNI and in on-chain records. This means that the Spark Protocol can now understand the retrieval performance of each Storage Provider at a file retrieval level.

N.B. Spark is making file CID retrievals not piece CID retrievals.
","Prior Art: Previous Filecoin retrieval bots retrieved pieces from Storage Provider by their Piece CID. These requests were made from a set of Protocol Labs controlled servers. 

Spark improves on this in the following ways.

- Spark is the first retrieval protocol that samples and measures payload (or file) CID retrievals instead of piece CIDs. This matches what future hot retrieval traffic will look like.

- Spark, leveraging the Station Network, uses a decentralised network of clients to make the requests and rewards them in FIL. This means that Storage Providers are much less able to distinguish between real traffic and sample traffic and so must provide a good service to both. This also keeps the infra costs in the Filecoin ecosystem rather than going to cloud giants.

- Spark uses FVM for managing the payouts to Station Operators running the Spark client.

Spark is now making around 20m retrieval requests a day to Filecoin Storage Providers and it is requesting roughly half a million different file CIDs each week.

Spark now is able to calculate the retrieval success rate by Storage Provider and we can see that while some SPs are providing a very good service, many are not providing hot retrievals at all. The visibility into this can now help us improve the Filecoin Retrieval Success Rate.

We co-locate these networks, map the shared problems hindering their progress, and facilitate collaborative processes to discover and catalyze the development and adoption of technological solutions. We envision a scientific process that leverages technology to measurably stabilize, enhance, and democratize the supply chain of science, making the system itself more efficient, open, and accessible.

Through physical and virtual workshops, network and community building initiatives, and directed ecosystem support and engagement, SciOS creates a Collaborative environment that connects academics, researchers, technologists, innovators, funders, policy makers, institutions, corporations, and the public with one another as well as with their peers. We leverage these connections to identify, support, accelerate, and lead the adoption of collaborative technological solutions that streamline the research process and foster open science practices driven by open-source software.

The inaugural series of SciOS workshops, SciOS24, addressed issues in critical infrastructure of science, including data storage and compute, FAIR data practices, identity management, funding and incentive design, and AI integration. These workshops brought together leading technicians and engineers in both open science and web3, fostering collaboration and innovation to tackle the challenges facing scientific infrastructure today.

SciOS24 set the stage for ongoing events and programs aimed at establishing a technology-based scientific infrastructure where open science is the default mode of knowledge discovery and translation. Notably, the event, enabled by Protocol Labs, DeSci Labs, Gridcoin, and The AI Alliance exposed over 200 legacy organizations, corporations, institutions, and open source projects to technical solutions for the problems plaguing scientific infrastructure. These solutions include those within the Filecoin ecosystem.

For example, the open state data networks track brought together ecosystem partners such as DeSci Labs, Naptha AI, and IPFS with leading external technicians such as Ceramic, Orbis DB, and the GoFAIR foundation to explore how technical solutions can be woven into the future fabric of the infrastructure for scientific progress.

Ultimately, SciOS24 benefited track and workshop leads along with participants by providing a space to work together on shared solutions to deep tech problems. 

SciOS’s enduring vision is to connect web3 technologies to the existing open-source and open science ecosystems. 

SciOS directly impacts the Filecoin and broader Web3 ecosystem through collective efforts to enhance infrastructure resilience and interoperability, broaden community breadth and engagement, and establish technical collaborations with projects outside of Web3 bubble.

# Use of Funds

Funds will be used to support SciOS in:

- The formation of a continuous interest group under the [Open Source Science Initiative](https://opensource.science) (OSSci) at [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org). OSSci is an initiative that connects the worlds of open source and open science; it bridges the divide between researchers and open source research software. The SciOS interest group (likely to be called “Technology and AI in Open Science) will be dedicated to showcasing technologies, learning about other tools/technologies in the ecosystem, and discuss technology and open science with other stakeholders deeply invested in the open science, open source, and web3 movements. Examples of technologies the group will explore include, but are not limited to, distributed storage, distributed compute, and AI. The SciOS interest group will be joining already existing interest groups in Life Sciences (chaired by Eileen Koski), Chemistry/Materials Science (chaired by Dmitry Zubarev), Climate and Sustainability (chaired by Eloisa Bentivegna), and Economics (chaired by Michael Zargham).

- The expansion of the workshop event model at major web3 and open science/open source conferences and events such as SciPy, the Open Source Summit, PyData, and All Things Open. Instead of asking those who web3 technology is intended to support to leave the comfort of their own community, SciOS will go to them.

- Including the Web3 ecosystem in MOSS to help visualize the existence and impact of technology, tools, dependencies, programs, initiatives, organizations, funding routes, people, and scientific datasets within the Web3 ecosystem and how these technologies connect to and support the open source and open science communities.

UCAN is an ecosystem-wide standard that has been adopted by a number of different projects, notably Fission’s set of IPFS-related products, and NFT Storage and Web3 Storage’s new API and backend.","The UCAN standard has been developed over a period of years, but the pre-1.0 version of the spec (v0.10) was finalized in September 2023, allowing the work to be built on by all its users. The working group is comprised of multiple orgs coming together to produce code, specs, and community to solve real user problems in the ecosystem for decentralized auth.

Web3 Storage’s move to a new w3up API, built on UCAN (https://blog.web3.storage/posts/intro-to-ucan), took place in Nov 2023. The benefit of working from a ecosystem-agreed standard meant that not only could this switch be made with some confidence, but also that other organizations could work compatibly with Web3/NFT storage using the same standard: a vital step given the amount of interoperability that an authorization system needs for the widest adoption and use.

The working group is currently wrapping up a stable v1.0, including initial Rust, Wasm, and JS implementations.

Convening, documenting, resolving and maintaining standards is a classic public good: everyone benefits, but the rewards for individuals to contribute are far smaller than the total advantage for all.","UCAN forms the auth and/or RPC basis of many projects in the ecosystem, including W3S, web3.storage/NTF.storage, IPVM, the Webnative File System, the Noosphere protocol, and others. It has lead to the development of several related standards and protocols including but not limited to the Varsig signature multiformat, Inline IPLD, AWAKE secure device linking, and brought familiar UX to users while enhancing their overall security.","['RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT', 'INFRASTRUCTURE', 'TOOLING']",['ucan-wg'],"['ucan-wg/awake', 'ucan-wg/go-ucan', 'ucan-wg/invocation', 'ucan-wg/rs-ucan', 'ucan-wg/spec', 'ucan-wg/ts-ucan', 'ucan-wg/ucan-community-web', 'ucan-wg/ucan-http-bearer-token']",8,64,421,,,"[1, 1, 2, 1, 10, 1, 7, 6, 2]"
Verifiable Data Aggregation,0xc896ea2ed908822f5f9c2f3e4966d360093b644dd30f98e3e0cbd9dd94d7bb23,"Verifiable Data Aggregation enables trust-less onboarding of small pieces of data, an area currently underserved by Filecoin. We've worked with existing storage aggregators to integrate Proof Of DataSegment Inclusion (PoDSI), and new applications are built on top of it. It is set to become a basis for L2 data markets, increasing the ease of use of Filecoin and opening new opportunities.","Our project introduces a new mechanism, the Proof of Data Segment Inclusion (PoDSI), designed to improve the transparency and accountability of data aggregation processes on the Filecoin network. The core innovation of PoDSI is its ability to generate cryptographic proofs that confirm the inclusion of individual data segments within larger aggregated deals. These proofs are verifiable independently by any third party, which significantly enhances the trustworthiness and reliability of data storage on Filecoin.

The primary contributions of our project are as follows:

- Development of the PoDSI Scheme: We have developed a detailed specification and corresponding cryptographic protocol that allows data aggregators to produce a Proof of Data Segment Inclusion. This proof certifies that a client's data segment has been correctly aggregated and included in a larger on-chain deal without being altered or omitted.

- Implementation of the Proving Library (go-data-segment): We created a robust library in Go that implements the PoDSI protocol. This library facilitates the generation and verification of inclusion proofs by aggregators and third parties, respectively.

- Integration Assistance: Our team has actively worked with prominent storage solutions like Lighthouse and web3.storage to integrate the PoDSI functionality.

- On-chain Verifier Development: In collaboration with the Lighthouse team, we assisted in implementing an on-chain verifier for PoDSI. This tool enables the automatic verification of proofs directly within the Filecoin blockchain, further securing and automating the process.
","The introduction and implementation of PoDSI have substantial impacts on the Filecoin ecosystem and its users:

- Enhanced Data Integrity and Trust: By enabling the verification of data inclusion without needing to trust the aggregators blindly, PoDSI fosters a higher degree of trust and security. Clients can independently verify that their data is correctly handled and stored, which is crucial for sensitive or critical information.

- Economic Efficiency: PoDSI allows for the economical provable onboarding of smaller data segments that previously could not be economically stored individually on Filecoin. This capability supports a broader range of use cases and clients, particularly those dealing with small but valuable datasets.

- Enablement of New Applications and Services: The verifiable aggregation mechanism opens up new possibilities for dApps that require verified data storage. It also lays the groundwork for secondary markets for data and new forms of decentralized data services.

- Support for L2 Data Markets: By providing a basis for Layer 2 data markets, PoDSI enhances the usability and functionality of the Filecoin network beyond primary storage solutions. It supports the creation of more complex, programmable, and interactive data services.

- Contribution to the Filecoin and FEVM Ecosystems: By making small data a ""first-class citizen"" within the Filecoin ecosystem, PoDSI greatly contributes to the overall robustness and appeal of the Filecoin network and its emerging smart contract platform, the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM).

In conclusion, our project not only strengthens the existing infrastructure of Filecoin by introducing a crucial layer of verification but also expands the network’s utility and opens up new economic opportunities within the decentralized storage market.",['RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT'],"['filecoin-project/fips', 'filecoin-project/go-data-segment']",['filecoin-project/fips'],1,160,310,2020-09-10 23:17:17.000000 UTC,2024-05-24 22:36:56.000000 UTC,"[5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0]"
