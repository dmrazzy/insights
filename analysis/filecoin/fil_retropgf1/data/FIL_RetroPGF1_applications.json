This includes:\n\n-Reviewing the FIP-0056 and CDM debate (https://medium.com/block-science/reviewing-the-fip-0056-and-cdm-debate-on-filecoin-6a6af0ed4b78), as cited in governance forum discussions: a timely, scientific analysis at the height of the FIP-0056 and CDM governance debate, presented in the form of a blog post, to dispel misinformation and inform the community to be able to meaningfully participate in discussions, towards a viable path forward. This post received very positive feedback from the community and has been referenced in governance forum posts since. \n\n-Past work on educating about Termination Fee, as per \"Exploring the Filecoin Termination Fee\" (https://medium.com/block-science/exploring-the-filecoin-termination-fee-9351fd40340e - April 2023) was directly relevant to the governance discussions on the Termination Penalty (#691, #712 and #724 May to July 2023), which then evolved to the discussions related to improving Storage Reliability on Filecoin (#843, October 2023)\n\n-Work on articulating and educating on the inner workings of the Baseline Minting and Consensus Pledge was important for the governance discussions on FIP-0081 (#847, Oct-Dec 2023), as per \"A cadCAD Interactive Calculator to Explore Minting Scenarios in Filecoin\" (https://medium.com/block-science/a-cadcad-interactive-calculator-to-explore-minting-scenarios-in-filecoin-284009a2e941 - Mar 2022).",
      "impactDescription": "These contributions to Filecoin governance were informed by years of dedicated research, analysis, and development, as well as a strong commitment to innovation, stability, and progress in Filecoin as a critical component of the digital commons. The open nature of outputs creates public goods artifacts that are seminal to informed and engaged collective governance of Filecoin network.\n\nThis analysis and tooling has had a positive impact on Filecoin governance in the past six months, for example: \n\n* Governance Research plus the FIP-0056 debate conclusions was a relevant driver for the FIP0001v2 Initiative (#799) (August 2023 and currently ongoing) its consequent PR for updating the FIP-0001 (October 2023 and currently ongoing) which is an WIP item that has the potential for solving some community demands in terms of further governance scheme improvements, as per the #945 conversation initiated by the Asia SP-WG in February 2024.\n\n* Some of the salient points that were made clear on the FIP-0056 are still ongoing, as made evident by the discussion around the Quality Multiplier, such as: Discussion on sunsetting FIL+ (#774, FIP-0080, Aug-Oct 2023),\n\"Reasons and Suggestions for Increasing the Quality Multiplier of Filecoin Networks\" (#833, Sep-Nov 2023)\n\n* Discussions on the general Filecoin Protocol Architecture in terms of its Master Plan (discussion #725, June to July 2023), as made evident by the citation of the FIP-0056 debate article for its summarized description of the Filecoin Economy.",

      "contributionDescription": "Boost has significantly transformed the landscape for storage providers on the Filecoin network by decoupling the Filecoin market protocol from the sealing software stack. This has allowed storage providers to manage data onboarding and retrieval more efficiently and flexibly.\n\n1. New deal making protocol focused on using HTTP data transfer protocol for deal data transfer to replace the existing Graphsync protocol.\n\n2. Booster-HTTP: This component operates as a HTTP gateway within the Boost setup. It facilitates the retrieval of data through HTTP protocols, enhancing the flexibility and accessibility for retrieving stored files. Notably, recent updates have moved towards a trustless gateway system, named Frisbii, which does not support the previous unixfs file format. Instead, users needing to handle unixfs formatted files are advised to run an additional binary known as bifrost-gateway. This shift ensures retrieval verifiability by default, aiming to boost the security and reliability of data transactions\u200b\u200b.\n\n3. Booster-Bitswap: This component uses the Bitswap protocol, a block exchange protocol native to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). It plays a crucial role in connecting IPFS network with Filecoin network by allowing IPFS nodes to directly fetch the data from Filecoin network.\n\n4. IPNI integration: Boost is the original data source for IPNI protocol. It allows SP to publish the list of CIDs they hold and retrieval mechanism which can be used to retrieve the data.\n",
      "impactDescription": "Adoption and Network Growth: The Boost project has significantly impacted the Filecoin network by facilitating over 5500PiB of \n peak Quality-Adjusted Power (QAP). This demonstrates substantial growth in storage capacity and effectiveness, ensuring that Filecoin's network becomes more robust and capable of handling large-scale data storage needs.\n\nEnhanced Data Retrieval Capabilities: Boost has revolutionized the way data is retrieved from the Filecoin network by enabling the retrieval network to fetch data using various data transfer protocols. This flexibility allows for more efficient data handling and access, catering to a wider range of use cases and enhancing user experience.\n\nNew mk1.2.x Protocol: The introduction of the new mk1.2.x protocol as part of Boost\u2019s framework has brought significant improvements in deal data transfer. These improvements enhanced the overall deal making experience for storage provider and client alike for the online deals.\n",

This feature along with many other ones are vastly popular among SPs to cut down OPex and to gain maximum utilization from hardwares.\n- Damocles is the first to incorporate Supranational proof into production storage providing systems, which allows SPs to enjoy a massive speed boost in computing proofs for P2, C2, snapdeal and windowPost. The lightning fast proof integration enabled by - - Damocles' unique architecture grants many SPs a stellar edge in their storage providing business.\nBased on the constructive feedbacks and close engagement with SPs, external processor, configuration manager, windowPost execution and Lotus compatibility manager of Damocles have been refactored and improved on to offer an outstanding user experience for SPs to reduce their operation overhead in managing storage power for Filecoin network.",

This new capability opens the door for sophisticated and advanced new applications. The steep economic cost of participating in reward mining has long stimulated a need for storage providers to seek additional support through external financing. Even though the FVM allows for transparency through contract verification, it is difficult to inspect or verify the capacity of a liquidity provider. \n\nWhereas solutions such as DeFillama depend on self-reported statistics which can be gamed, the DeFi Leaderboard is one of the very few projects to directly calculate liquidity flow through on-chain calculations. Starboard\u2019s DeFi Leaderboard adds new verifiability and trust to the high economic stakes of liquidity provision. \n\nStakeholders served by the DeFi Leaderboard include storage providers, individual investors, liquidity providers, blockchain analytics firms, and product/governance officials at Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Foundation. \n",

To introduce an element of verifiability to liquidity provision, Starboard\u2019s DeFi leaderboard offers an independent calculation of both deposits and borrowings from liquid staking pools directly from the blockchain. \n\nBlockchain analytics firms and product/governance teams at Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Foundation have a need to track the evolution of liquidity provision to the Filecoin network for both analytics and monitoring purposes. The DeFi Leaderboard satisfies this need, not only by tracking staking and borrowing activity, but also by tabulating these flows over time. We are thus able to tell periods of growth and decline in the overall DeFi landscape in Filecoin. \n",
      "impactDescription": "Storage providers and individual investors now have access to information about liquid staking pools which are independently verified at the individual transaction level, offering both lenders and borrowers assurance about the veracity of DeFi protocols\u2019 lending activities. \n\nAnalytics and governance teams from blockchain analytics companies and PL/FF have access to instant highlight figures tracking the growth of liquidity provision. Our figures are trusted and cited widely by groups such as Messari, or Filecoin TLDR. \n\nA notable example that has arisen recently is the unexpected legal troubles experienced by the stFIL protocol in April 2024.

The main goal of drand is to provide all the tooling required to use public randomness  (i.e. random values that are meant to be public) in a verifiable manner.\n\nThe League of Entropy and drand are being used by a variety of projects, from NGOs selecting their next UBI recipients in Sierra Leone, to leader election in Filecoin consensus mechanisms, to online gambling websites and blockchain smart contracts.\n\nThe ongoing maintenance and stewardship of drand as an open-source software is essential to guarantee continued access to verifiable randomness as a public good for everybody to use whenever they have a need for public randomness.",

      "impactDescription": "In the period covered by this RetroPGF round, the drand team have launched a new, faster network that allows stateless verification of drand beacons. This speeds up verification of randomness for SPs, reduces bandwidth requirements, reduces latency and reduces the required storage for drand beacons in block headers. This was proposed in FIP-63 but isn't live yet on Filecoin.\n\nThe relays operated by the team also provided over 7000 GB of low latency, high availability bandwidth to Filecoin SPs, serving over 2 billions requests from the Filecoin network in the period covered by this RetroPGF round.\n\nThe drand beacons are then used in PoRep, Leader election, FEVM and more places in Filecoin, constituting a very important building block for the rest of the ecosystem.",

We have since spun out at Nova Energy to continue this critical work.\n\n1. Validation and Recognition: The EVP offers SPs a pathway to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability through data-driven validation. By submitting detailed information on energy consumption, production, and eco-conscious practices, SPs not only receive recognition in the form of an audit output and sustainability claim but also pave the way for possible economic incentives tied to their Green Scores.\n\n2. Holistic Impact Assessment: The Green Scores Methodology goes beyond simplistic metrics to provide a nuanced evaluation of SP\u2019s environmental impact. By considering factors such as emissions intensity, location-specific effects on the power grid, and data integrity, this methodology offers a comprehensive assessment that reflects the complex realities of sustainable data storage and Storage Provider operations.\n\n3. Incentivizing Sustainability: In the future, we intend to tie Green Scores to economic benefits, such as reputation score boosts and access to green financing opportunities, which will enable the EVP and Green Scores Methodology to incentivize SPs to prioritize sustainability. This will not only benefit individual SPs but also contribute to the broader goal of reducing the environmental impact and advancing Filecoin's commitment to a greener future.",

The Station network is the perfect fit for the Spark protocol as it offers a heterogeneous and geo-distributed set of nodes from which to make retrievals, ensuring that Storage Providers are not able to ascertain which clients are creating the sample traffic and which clients are creating the real traffic.\n\nWeb3 UX: The UX for new operators has been the top priority of the Station initiative. The UX for getting set up on Station is very straightforward and doesn't require technical chops. Operators often remark on how simple it is to get set up and start earning FIL. Whereas becoming a Storage Provider takes a lot of technical and financial clout and is a very serious undertaking, running a Filecoin Station node can be done by anyone with a computer, and it simply runs in the background. Once onboarded, new Station Operators have taken the first step towards learning and understanding more about the Filecoin Ecosystem.\n",

This literally means over 11k new Filecoin network participants now have some FIL assigned to their wallet.\n\nThe Spark module running on Station is currently making 22M retrieval requests per day for around 65k new CIDs per day and measuring the Retrieval Success rate of Storage Providers.\n",

One aspect that contributed to the success of HeartBit in the past months is that it is compatible with native crypto social media and leverages protocols like Safe and Hats. \n\nFor example, at EthDenver we created a website to combine onchain and offchain experiences for people https://ethdenver.fileverse.io/ . Visitors were able to share the speaker profile of anyone speaking at EthDenver, in one click, as a Frame or Open Action. Every person interacting with the Frame/OpenAction could find IPFS-addressed content and mint HeartBits onchain with a hash pointing the HeartBit back to the actual content on IPFS.\n",

      "impactDescription": "While it has users today who benefit from the ability to do verifiable chain queries without a full node, the primary impact has been in demonstrating that the Filecoin protocol has many of the pieces in place to make light clients usable today while also identifying the areas of code, documentation, and infrastructure that would be needed to make Filecoin light clients usable in an even wider variety of use cases.\n\nIt has also been a demonstration of how Filecoin can itself enable light clients for other networks by storing and serving light client data with no need for protocol-specific smarts on the Filecoin SPs.",

This allows borrowers, referred to as SPs (Storage Providers), to access $FIL liquidity without the need for traditional crypto or fiat collateral.

This unique approach enables SPs to bolster their storage power without incurring additional financial burdens, fostering continuous expansion within the Filecoin ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, Filliquid participants can\u00a0optimize their earnings by farming $FIG, the platform's governance token.

We contribute to the Filecoin ecosystem, allowing $FIL holders to earn a yield on their holdings through a secure, decentralized, and audited lending infrastructure. At the same time, storage providers can come and use the $FIL previously pledged in their nodes as collateral to secure $FIL loans for the sole purpose of expanding their storage capacity. \n\nThe ecosystem is designed to connect $FIL holders to storage providers, helping the latter experience reduced financial burdens for providing storage on the Filecoin network. \n\nCurrently, storage providers are obligated to pledge $FIL to the network every time they expand storage or onboard new clients. Our contribution ensures that storage providers \u2014 one of the most integral components of the Filecoin ecosystem \u2014 may obtain $FIL without digging into their pockets for liquid assets by binding their miner nodes to the FILLiquid smart contract to serve as collateral. \n\nWhile the loan is outstanding, all future $FIL mining rewards are pledged to the smart contract, and the $FIL in the node is also pledged, providing security for lenders. In the case of a default, the $FIL pledged in the miner node can replenish the defaulted $FIL in the liquidity pool, keeping lenders safe.\n\nThe following are the contributions by FILLiquid to build the Filecoin Ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Discussion\nActively arranged several X-Space Discussions, primarily focusing on FVM and Filecoin. The conversation covered hotspots in the ecosystem and technology, like FVM, which successfully brought together OG, experts, and active teams to promote Filecoin's mission.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@filfox.io/filfox-filliquid-ama-bedd503e374c\nhttps://x.com/filfox_info/status/1717538981309710746?s=46\nhttps://twitter.com/FILLiquid/status/1760455817893929341\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/live/video?roomId=2182213\nhttps://twitter.com/FILLiquid/status/1762462918698729817\n\nArticles\nWe actively post articles on the newest developments and news on Filecoin on Medium.

      "impactDescription": "FILLiquid\u2019s impact will help secure the sustainable growth of the Filecoin storage capacity, allowing it to continue competing with the heavyweight centralized storage markets, such as Amazon W3. \n\nThe pledging requirements for Filecoin storage providers present an opportunity cost between using funds for expanding storage hardware or obtaining $FIL to expand storage capacity. \n\nWith AI systems presenting an ever-growing market for decentralized data storage services, Filecoin can be the leading provider as long as it can keep pace with AI models' expansive storage capacity needs.\n\nWhile the pledging requirements might not burden storage providers at low token prices, the dilemma will become apparent as the $FIL token value rises and aquiring $FIL for pledging becomes more burdensome. \n\nOur solution allows storage providers to achieve both. They can use their liquid funds to buy hardware to expand their business capacity while using the previously pledged illiquid $FIL in their nodes as collateral to secure more $FIL to add more pledges and expand storage power.\n\nThis impact eases the financial burden for storage providers, expands storage power growth, and lets $FIL holders earn a yield. \nOverall, FILLiquid deepens the $FIL liquid available to storage providers, helping Filecoin to experience consistent and sustainable storage power growth over time.\n\nThe following is the impact that FILLiquid generated.\n\nCommunity Discussion\nOver 1,000 people tuned in, listened and watched the AMA and Youtube videos.\n\nArticles\nClaps 29,988\nViews 14579\nReads 7581\n\nCommunity\nDiscord >10K\nTelegram > 3,427\nTwitter > 30.2K",

We have successfully participated in the last three mainnet network upgrades without issue, as well as the upcoming NV22 on Calibnet. Performance and stability are good, however we continue to optimize and improve many components.\n\nOverall the performance of Forest is a significant advantage over other implementations, requiring only a 4-core CPU and 16GB of RAM to perform even the most resource intensive operations. \n\nSnapshot generation and archival data export capabilities are two examples of Forest\u2019s emerging potential. Through various optimizations, primarily on the storage layer (learn more:https://youtu.be/9PZbsF0ah64?si=6-wItLWXJXB7g_9g), Forest can generate snapshots on modest hardware and in less than half the time compared to Lotus. Similarly, exports of archival chain data have similar performance advantages and are half the size on disk with a slower growth rate over time.\n\nForest's snapshot and archival data export capabilities are actively being demonstrated through the\u00a0Forest Snapshot & Archival Data service(https://forest.chainsafe.io/#snapshot-service). The service leverages Forest's significant performance benefits to generate snapshots and export archival data, which are made available for the community free of charge. This service is now the canonical source for snapshots for the entire network.\n\nThe RPC interface is a work in progress and will be a core focus for the coming months. Presently only a limited set of methods are implemented, largely due to the absence of a specification. The status of the RPC interface can be tracked in\u00a0this project: https://github.com/orgs/ChainSafe/projects/29/.

Through this service we have demonstrated Forest\u2019s fantastic performance generating snapshots 3x faster on using 1/16th of the memory, compared to the now defunct service setup by Protocol Labs.

The initial data was sourced from Sentinel at a cost of ~$4000 USD, and is now available to the community free of charge. This service is hugely valuable in providing data availability to the network outside of the protocol, as it is presently very difficult to run full archival nodes and very few exist on the network today.\n\nFunding note: While Forest has received funding from the FF, there was no budget included for infrastructure costs, which ChainSafe has ultimately covered.

      "bio": "With 9 international conferences since its inauguration in 2021, Funding the Commons is a referential event series across strategic markets for PGF innovation. FtC has also been organizing successful builder residencies, numerous public goods funding hackathons, as well select impact pilot projects leveraging the tools platformed across its ecosystem. \n\nWithin the web3 ecosystem, FtC has established itself as the premier conference for PFG advancements, specifically targeting builders and innovators within the Filecoin and IPFS networks. \n\nBy providing a platform for these individuals to showcase their work and connect with public goods funders, FtC has been instrumental in fostering collaborations and bringing to light the contributions of the Filecoin community to a broader audience. This initiative has bridged the gap between Filecoin and the wider public goods funding ecosystem, encompassing both web3 and web2 spaces, thereby facilitating an environment where ideas and methodologies for sustaining open-source projects can flourish and evolve. \n\nA pivotal aspect of Funding the Commons' dedication to supporting public goods builders is the creation of the [Builder Basic Income Fund on Drips](https://www.drips.network/app/drip-lists/36167722434539895740687283110259945938004377627588501179309095983175). This initiative serves as a concrete mechanism to offer continuous financial support to developers, allowing them to concentrate on adding value within open-source ecosystems without the burden of financial uncertainty. By ensuring a steady income for builders, Funding the Commons not only aids individual creators but also sets a new standard for public goods funding, encouraging other entities to adopt similar supportive measures.\n\nAdditionally, the launch of the Akashic project marks a significant milestone in Funding the Commons' efforts. This ambitious project aims to construct a digital archive of refugee stories on IPFS and Filecoin, safeguarding the memories, stories, and cultural heritage of refugees worldwide. Akashic's use of the decentralized and censorship-resistant properties of IPFS and Filecoin perfectly aligns with Filecoin's mission to offer a durable base for the preservation of human knowledge and history, ensuring these narratives remain immutable, accessible, and free from central oversight.\n\nSince 2024, Funding the Commons has inherited Sustainable Blockchain Summit (SBS) and is now building on the legacy of this second conference series focused on exploring new models & mechanisms to better steward planetary commons.",

      "contributionDescription": "FtC has achieved notable successes in enhancing the Filecoin ecosystem's visibility and operational capacity through strategic partnerships with key entities like Gitcoin and Optimism - these collaborations have been crucial in the operationalization of Filecoin's retroPGF, and have generated significant awareness within the Ethereum public goods community about Protocol Labs' contributions. \n\nFurthermore, FtC has acted as a crucial convening platform for various communities, including Hypercerts and DeSci, among others, that are actively building within the ecosystem. These efforts have not only spotlighted Filecoin's pivotal role in supporting public goods but also underscored the tangible impacts and contributions of Funding the Commons in propelling the Filecoin and IPFS ecosystems forward.\n\nPart of FtC\u2019s contribution as a convener is the relationship-facilitation between the PL & Filecoin ecosystem and other academic partners of FtC, including UC Berkeley and Stanford.\n\nBeyond its own events, FtC serves as a recruitment mechanism for other Public Goods Funding events. Most recently, FtC was the anchor and catalyst for [LabWeek24](https://www.labweek.io/24-pg) held by Protocol Labs in the SF Bay Area. Building off of the FtC event planning, this allowed hundreds of attendees to Filecoin retroPGF events, DeSci, Blockchain Innovation Forum, [amongst many others](https://www.labweek.io/24-pg/schedule/calendar).\n\nFtC team inherited SBS, a cherished conference initiated through Filecoin Green that platforms web3 sustainability initiatives and is growing it in a new form: Earth Commons. SBS was instrumental in showcasing projects and initiatives that demonstrated the potential of decentralized technologies, such as Filecoin and IPFS, in addressing environmental challenges. In 2024, FtC has already successfully built partnerships with other stakeholders, including Hyphen.Earth, Ma Earth, and Gain Forest, that are taking an increasing role in the co-production and stewardship of SBS into the future. We have already reached more people (digitally) in the past 90 days than SBS ever did, and we are in the process of significantly growing an engaged audience through this platform aimed at recruiting into the PGF conversation leveraging climate media tactics (see impact metrics below).",
      "impactDescription": "Funding the Commons has played a vital role in championing the development of the Filecoin and IPFS ecosystems through its robust support for public goods builders, cross-ecosystem collaborations, and pioneering initiatives like the Akashic archive. These endeavors highlight the organization's significant contributions to shaping the future of public goods funding and underscore its worthiness as a candidate for Filecoin's retroPGF round support.\n\nFtC directly supported the production of other LabWeek events, such as WikiAI hackathon, Public Goods Funding dinner, CodeX Future Law @ Stanford Law School, and recruited speakers who spoke at various LabWeek events.\n\nPart of our work in building and connecting the public goods funding ecosystem includes facilitating the interconnectivity of the Filecoin ecosystem with other public goods funding ecosystems, such Optimism retroPGF which inspired the current Filecoin retroPGF campaign. In this way, Funding the Commons contributes to influence Filecoin\u2019s public goods funding landscape.\n\nQualitative Feedback from Social about our recent Berkeley conferences: [https://fundingthecommons.notion.site/Berkeley-Praise-Social-Tags-f1be8fdcb6874087ab52cdd48c5180d6?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/f1be8fdcb6874087ab52cdd48c5180d6?pvs=21)",

We showed that there are tighter bounds which lead to a more concrete cost calculation, showing that the current security margin is instead 168x (this is a 84x improvement!).

This new capability opens the door for sophisticated and advanced new applications. For example, FVM makes it possible to devise decentralised financing for Filecoin\u2019s storage providers, executed through a wide variety of financing and business models. With the FVM comes the need to carefully scrutinise smart contracts and transactions as they are happening. Important stakeholders include developers of Web3 applications based on smart contracts, retail users of these applications, and engineering/production/governance teams on Filecoin who seek to track smart contract uptake and adoption. \n\nStarboard\u2019s FVM Explorer is a true block explorer, providing live information about smart contracts and their associated transactions at the block level. FVM Explorer provides rankings of contracts according to user, activity, gas usage and other metrics, allowing users to understand the key smart contracts influencing the Filecoin VM. Finally, FVM Explorer includes a suite of utilities to allow tooling developers to verify their smart contracts through an API or through the Hardhat plugin. \n",

Stakeholders include Web3 app and tooling developers; regular users of said applications; and product, engineering and governance teams at Protocol Labs. \n\nWeb3 app and tooling developers need to scrutinise events at a transactional and contract level to debug development tools and for validation and monitoring purposes. FVM Explorer addresses this need by providing low latency access to smart contract events. \n\nWeb3 is a nascent frontier and a key obstacle to broader adoption is suspicion and a trust deficit. Therefore, the need to offer users reassurance about app functionality is a strong pain point for many app developers. FVM Explorer addresses this need by offering an extensive suite of tools to verify source code. In the period Oct 2023 to Mar 2024, Starboard has continued to boost FVM Explorer by adding a suite of contract verification tools (https://fvm.starboard.ventures/explorer/verifier) that allow users to confirm that a smart contract\u2019s source code matches the deployed code byte for byte. This contract verification process provides confidence in the integrity of an application and promotes transparency among smart contracts in FVM. \n\nRegular users desire reassurance about what smart contracts are actually doing, particularly when large sums of token are at stake. FVM Explorer allows users the ability to directly inspect pre-verified source code and ABI of smart contracts, and establishes a source of truth for users to scrutinise individual smart contract transactions in granular detail. \n",

      "impactDescription": "1) \ud83c\udf10 Glif Nodes offers publicly available API service with over 99.95% of availability with over 230,000 unique IP addresses sending over 4 billion requests per month.\n\n\u2753 Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let\u2019s simplify: \n\nIt is a service similar to a highly reliable public library that's open almost all the time\u2014virtually 24/7\u2014where over 230,000 people from different places visit monthly. \n\nImagine each visitor using the library more than once, amounting to over 4 billion requests for books every month. \n\nJust as a library serves its community by providing free access to knowledge, Glif API nodes provide crucial data and services to users of the Filecoin network. Glif nodes' near-perfect availability ensures that anyone relying Filecoin's digital 'library' can access the information they need anytime, without interruptions, making Glif service a dependable and essential resource for the community.\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Who is the end user that benefits from the project: Filecoin Network users who want to e.g. make the transactions or connect the Metamask; dApps; The Filecoin Core Team. All those groups use the nodes that we are running.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Key Metrics: 4 billion requests every month from 230k different IPs, over 99.95% of availability. \n\n\ud83d\udccb Proof of Work: \nhttps://monitoring.node.glif.io/public-dashboards/6eab5f7a31fa4eebb27b6c23c53e9afe \nhttps://status.node.glif.io/\n\n2) \u2705 Glif Node provides a CID Checker - a tool to check any CID in the network.\n\n\u2753 Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let\u2019s simplify:\nCID Checker works much like a tracking system for packages. In the digital world of the Filecoin network, where files and information are sent and stored across a decentralized system, each piece of content is given a unique label, known as a CID (Content Identifier). \n\nThis label helps to track and locate specific pieces of content within the network, just like a postal tracking number allows you to see where your package is and when it will arrive. The CID Checker allows anyone to enter this unique label and find out where the content is stored and how it can be accessed. It's a user-friendly tool that ensures transparency and accessibility, helping users feel confident and informed about where their data is held in the vast digital space.\n\n\ud83d\udccb Proof of Work: \nhttps://cid.filecoin.tools \n\n3) \ud83d\udcf6 Glif Nodes offers the service of bootstrap nodes for Filecoin Mainnet and testnet (aka Calibnet). \n\n\u2753 Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let\u2019s simplify: \nJust as the main pillars of a bridge ensure it stays upright and usable, bootstrap nodes act as foundational and primary connecting points that allows new node runners to discover and connect to other nodes in the network, making this contribution a public good essential to the network\u2019s health and functionality.\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Who is the end user that benefits from the project: Developers who build new projects and need to run their own node; miners within the network; users who simply want to run RPC nodes.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Key Metrics: 600+ nodes connected to our bootstrap node, which indicates that most of those users started their nodes with our service. \n\n4) \ud83d\udcca Glif Nodes creates comprehensive reports (StateMarketDeal dumps) that track the performance and activities within the Filecoin market. These reports are widely utilized by community members, including groups focused on maintaining network reputation (Reputation DAO) and various tools designed to analyze Filecoin data (FIL plus toolings, Filecoin data metric toolings, etc.). \n\n\u2753 Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let\u2019s simplify: \nThink of it as providing an accounting book that is used to perform health check-ups for the network, ensuring it operates smoothly and reliably, which is essential for anyone relying on this digital space to store or access their important information.\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Who is the end user that benefits from the project: Community members, including groups focused on maintaining network reputation (Reputation DAO) and various tools designed to analyze Filecoin data (FIL plus toolings, Filecoin data metric toolings, etc.). \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Key Metrics: https://github.com/data-preservation-programs/RetrievalBot/blob/main/integration%2Fstatemarketdeals%2Fmain.go#L67 \n\n5) \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f The Glif Nodes Team provides support to the ecosystem, users, core development teams and integrators. \n\n\u2753 Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let\u2019s simplify: \nThe Glif Nodes Team acts like a supportive neighbor in the community of the Filecoin network. Just as good neighbors help each other out, we offer timely community and partner support to various groups and projects within the ecosystem, encouraging its growth and development. \n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Who is the end user that benefits from the project: users, core development teams and integrators. \n\n\ud83d\udccb Proof of Work: one of the reviews of our support from Raul Kripalani, Tech Lead at Filecoin. \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12mTcLMHzTpNJnw59XYGh_LtpIPXtf_tT/view?usp=sharing\n\n6) \ud83d\ude80 Recently, Glif Nodes Team has been working closely with the IPC team to set up several new networks. In recent days Glif works closely with the IPC (Interplanetary Consensus) team running several installations of the Mycelium network and helping with bootstrap of the first production IPC network - Fluence.\n\n\ud83d\ude00 In this example we assume that it\u2019s pretty understandable, but we\u2019re happy to provide answers to any questions that might arise. \n\n\ud83d\udccb Proof of Work: https://explorer.fluence.dev/provider/0x41c896e8c7a14cb266e1ccda29e436293d74bfd9\nhttps://api.mycelium.calibration.node.glif.io/\nhttps://explorer.mycelium.calibration.node.glif.io/\nhttps://faucet.mycelium.calibration.node.glif.io/\n \n\n7) \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Glif Nodes supplies several essential software components for developers in a ready-to-use form - Docker images, Infrastructure-as-Code tool and Helm charts.\n\n\u2753 Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let\u2019s simplify: \n\nWe supply several essential software components for developers much like how a pre-assembled furniture kit makes it easy to set up a bookshelf without needing to understand carpentry. These software 'kits' help various organizations within the Filecoin network easily build and manage their systems, enhancing efficiency and accessibility. \n\n\ud83d\udccb Examples of such services delivered by Glif Nodes to Filecoin community are: \n\na) Filecoin Docker images that are nowadays just as popular as the Docker images supported by the Filecoin core team; they help developers to quickly spin up their own nodes on the Filecoin network. Devs just need to download the image and run it. \nb) The Filecoin-IaC tool that allows reducing efforts for users who are willing to spin up thousands of Filecoin nodes. Without the tool they would have to repeat this process thousand times scaling the process \nc) The Filecoin-chart tool that does same thing as Filecoin-IaC but over Kubernetes\n",

It also provides functionality to split large CAR files into smaller CAR files to ensure that the whole IPLD dag is maintained intact but at the same time CAR file sizes are small enough to fit into a sector.",
      "impactDescription": "This has been the main tool used by two high-visibility projects to prepare data to be onboarded to filecoin.\nInternet Archive -- Internet Archive runs their own data preparation on commodity hardware. As a result they often ran into issues such as aborted jobs due to insufficient memory. go-fil-dataprep solved this problem by significantly reducing the memory footprint, and at the same time also increased the throughput significantly. Secondly, the CAR-splitting functionality of go-fil-dataprep allowed for handling of files with size larger than sector size (32G/64G) without requiring splitting of the IPLD dag. By not splitting the DAG by external tools, we enabled streaming retrievals, for example for large movie archives.\nTriton (Solana RPC provider) -- The Solana collaboration with Filecoin has gained a lot of visibility recently. Triton took the lead in archiving Solana ledger data to Filecoin. The CAR files Triton was producing for each Solana epoch -- which is roughly a few hundred GBs in size today. By using the car-splitting functionality in go-fil-dataprep (carlet), Triton was able to maintain a single IPLD dag for the whole chain state and onboard data in a way that made retrievals seamless.",

      "impactDescription": "History Independence\nA key property of a Prolly tree that enables fast diff and structural sharing is history independence. No matter which order you insert, update, or delete values, the Prolly tree is the same. \n\nFast Diff\nGiven history independence, the Prolly Tree difference calculation becomes quite simple. If the hash of the root chunk is the same the entire subtree is the same. Thus, one must just walk the tree down to the leaves, ignoring hashes that are equal. Hashes that are different represent the difference.\n\nStructural Sharing\nRecall that Prolly trees are stored in a content addressed block store where the content address forms the lookup key for the block.\nThus, any blocks that share the same content address are only stored in the block store once. When they need to be retrieved they are retrieved via content address. This means that any blocks shared across versions will only be in the block store once.",

Its impact is woven across the Filecoin project, but for this application it fall into 2 major buckets:\n\n1. Building blocks for the Filecoin protocol: IPLD, a subproject of IPFS, is the data model of the content addressable web. IPLD's concepts and protocols such as DAG-CBOR, .car file format, and Graphsync are used extensively across the Filecoin spec and run in every Filecoin node.\n\n2. Storage user growth: IPFS has firmly established CIDs as the default of storage design for Web3. Its 10-year track record as \"the backbone of web3\" and ongoing new usage contribute to interest, credibility, and client lead generation for Filecoin. Many of Filecoin's storage users cite the efficiency and verifiability of CIDs, alongside cost, as a reason for choosing Filecoin (example: Victor Chang Cardiac Institute).",

      "impactDescription": "Peer to peer and decentralized applications have been popular lately, but almost all of them rely on synchronizing append only logs of operations (or an equivalent). This leads to performance degredation over time as data accumulates and needs to be processed on new peers before they can start querying and updating data within an existing swarm. This post will talk about how pre-indexed peer to peer databases can be built and how they can sidestep the need to process operation logs and query data more efficiently. The short of it is that with this new data structure, the network becomes your database instead of needing to build a database after loading everything from the network.\n\nP2P Social Apps\nA lot of social P2P apps right now use the append only logs method of synchronizing data and end up having large histories if they actually get used for a long period of time. Generally these apps also have users coming in and out from the swarm frequently and being offline for long periods of time. This leads users to commonly face the downsides of using append only logs. New users have to sit and wait for their databases to sync (sometimes for minutes, sometimes tens of minutes), and users that haven't been online for a while can still need to sit around a bit to get up to speed. Very active users that might be in a bunch of chatrooms at once will have that initial load multiplied by each chat they're participating in which can lead to sluggishness (see Matrix chat clients when you're in hundreds of rooms with thousands of people).\n\nIf these apps instead used p2p databases, they could drastically improve the initial load times. Instead of waiting for all of the history to sync, a client can focus on getting the set of most recently active users, and query their indexes for just the messages that are needed to render the current view. Detecting notifications like mentions or \"new messages\" can also be done by comparing your last seen state of somebody's index with the latest one. The app can then pull just the notifications since the last load (or last \"marked read\") or ignore those indexes entirely if a user has notifications turned off for that channel.\n\nOnce the intial load is in place and a user is set up to see the latest data, their client can then start slowly backing up more messages from peers to populat a chat history and help improve replication if the user wants their client to keep more messages available for offline use. In fact, using indexes within your data gives applications fine grained control over what data they do or don't want to have available locally.\n\nDepending on how you structure your post verification, you can make use of the prolly tree merging to combine users indexes togehter and perform searches accross the entire DB keyspace at once. This can simplify a lot of the code for querying data for views, but it comes with the tradeoff that you'll need to build more trust into your system so that users can't pretend to author posts on behalf of others. Generally you'll need to use public key cryptography to \"sign\" posts in addition to their data in order to verify the author's identity.\n\nIn general, developers can now use similar approaches to talking to \"backend\" databases, but skip having to actually set one up and pay for the maintenance that it requires.\n\nThis is also where encrypted DAGs would come in handy. If you want to have private groups or DMs, the easiest way to represent them is to have separate encrypted prolly trees and tie the users identity to whatever ones they're participating in.\n\nThere's also room to explore peer discovery around things like \"tags\" that people are talking about and to figure out how to send a message to somebody that isn't already aware of your existence on the network. I've written about this in the past with my P2P Inboxes post, and some of the tutorials I did using \"gossip protocols\".\n\nOverall, changing how peer to peer apps can exchange and merge data can give us some clear wins on user onboarding and on performance in general.\n\n\nBlockchain State\nPersonally, I'm not a huge fan of blockchain based technology. And one of the main reasons for that is just how many resources you need to get a chain running, and the centralizing effect that has on the network. In order to run a (even a proof of stake based) full node you typically need hundreds of GBs of harddisk storage, a whole bunch of RAM, and a bunch of CPU power spinning away. And once you have one, it needs to take a while to catch up with the chain, or use snapshots to catch up and keep going. This means that setting up full nodes isn't something the average person will be able to do and leads to groups with more spare capital or technical knowledge to set them up. For everyone else, they need to rely on other people's full nodes in order to query the blockchain state or post transactions (with exceptions that I'm not going to get into here).\n\nAs a result, most \"clients\" trying to use blockchains have to trust that the full node they're using isn't omitting data, and that it will be online fot them indefinitely. These full nodes typically keep a local database (like postgres or the such) and have an HTTP API for clients to connect to and ask for state. This HTTP API is where full nodes can impose arbitrary restrictions and start charing for access to the chain state. For example, if you're trying to use metamask to access some data, or some NFT platform, they effectively control your access to the chain via their centralized management of these HTTP APIs.\n\nWith p2p databases, we can sidestep the need for these HTTP APIs and central-ish databases in blockchain ecosystems. Instead of a blockchain existing to keep an append only log of blocks, and full nodes acting as indexers over that state in order to make it actually usable, what if the chain published both the latest block, and a link to the root of a Prolly Tree containing the indexes of all the data.\n\nFrom there a client could talk to any node participating in keeping the chain running and do their actual query on the data by traversing the peer to peer indexes. Instead of loading everything from a single node and depending on it to be online, a client can load subsets of the index from multiple nodes in paralell, and the more nodes exist in the chain the more available the data will be.\n\nThis can also be used to \"prove\" that a certain result was part of the blockchain state by linking to the root block, and the subset of the prolly tree which was used to satisfy the query. From there one could send these proofs around to different systems which can have implications for inter-chain communication and sending proofs without needing to be fully connected to the chain.\n\nBackups and fresh starts can also be improved in that a node can get the latest block from the chain and start loading the underlying prolly trees from the history while prioritizing blocks that are relevant to any smart contract calculations first. To be specific, a node can execute code that relies on the state before having a full copy of the state by being able to load the part of the prolly tree it needs on the fly from the rest of the network.\n\nStorage of the blockchain state can also be optimized thanks to the content addressibility. If only a small subset of the index changed, then all the other nodes in the tree will remain the same. It's kind of like compressing your DB right from the get go without losing the ability to roll back to earlier snapshots of your state.\n\nTo start, I'm hoping to work with the Filecoin FVM team to see if we can integrate Prolly Trees into their stack, and I'm likely going to reach out to some of the folks in the Cosmos Network via my collaboration with the Hypha worker cooperative.\n\nHopefully this has given you a bit of insight into how we can change the state of blockchain state (ha!). We can have new networks that are less dependent on central DBs, and therefore more resilient to outages and censorship. And we can make chains more efficient to participate in and search through.\n\n\nCross-Organizational Search\nAnother place where p2p search indexes would be useful is for indexing institutional data for text search. Specifically, it could be useful for projects doing archiving of data using WebRecorder to build up large datasets of crawled data. At the moment, it's possible to index data from these sources using traditional centralized databases like Elasticsearch, but this requires running centralized infrastructure and doesn't allow for sharing indexes between groups easily. Often this is done via external companies like Google which come in and set up search indexing on the institutions behalf and results in the institution relying on paying the third party to keep access to their own data.\n\nWith p2p databases we can begin to build up search indexes collaboratively with community members, where individuals or smaller groups can participate in generating indexed data, and larger indexes being formed from combining the smaller ones. For example, cultural institutions can start tracking data for use by their community, and they can also build bridges to other institutions in order to search through larger amounts of data without needing to delegate authority and ownership to a third party like Google.\n\nThis can apply outside of cultural institutions as well and can be used for curated search indexes for all sorts of use cases. Communities interested in a given topic can collaborate on search via prolly trees, scientific publishers and communities can combine their data, etc. Instead of having a centralized search engine like Google or Bing which is vulnerable to spam originating from untrusted and illrelevant parties, we can have smaller scale and more focused search indexes wich can be use and combined together based on who is interested in what. This is some of the paths that we're hoping to explore with the IPFS Search team by taking their existing indexed data and finding ways to ingest it into prolly trees and perform searches over top.\n\nBig Data\nAnother place I'm excited to explore with p2p databases is the world of \"big data\". At the moment people are coordinateing large cloud deployments to process and send data around. Usually, due to the amount of central coordination necessary for making \"big data\" viable, this is all mediated through a central authority which controls access and exchange of data on their network.\n\nIngtroducing p2p databases into the mix gives us new ways of approaching big data. In the first place it gives us a new way to scale out and shard large datasets accross multiple storage backends by storing subsets of a prolly tree accross several machines. Decoupling the storage from the authoring and reading layer can make it possible to spin up different components within a single cloud or accross people's home machines. Ingestion can be completely changed too in that instead of running ingestion on a single database or via some sort of map reduce cluster, one can split up sections of data to be ingested and indexed and combine the outputted prolly trees at a different layer accross many worker nodes.\n\nApart from scaling we can now have new ways of structuring data marketplaces where authors of datasets can encrypt prolly trees and sell decryption keys to others which can then process and refine the data and publish it themselves. This sale and publishing can either be done via centralized marketplaces, blockchains, or manually coordinated contracts accross organiations. In fact, having the underlying distribution and processing be decentralized can be a boon to making Data DAOs which manage and profit off of datasets.\n\nOne project I'm working with at the moment is Pando from KEN Labs which is planning on being an out of the box solution to aggregating and working with large p2p datasets. At the moment we don't have clear use cases to point to, but we'll be optimizing different prolly tree configurations and working with other groups in order to find the best settings for read and write performance as well as distributed ingestion pipelines.",

      "contributionDescription": "JiaoZiFS's versatility shines across different industries \u2013 making it the multi-purpose tool for the data centric applications and teams.\n\n1. Defining artificial intelligence in the context of lineage: Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that covers a variety of techniques and approaches that make it possible for machines to learn, adjust and act with intelligence comparable to the natural intelligence of humans. Lineage has direct implications for many of the techniques and approaches of AI, such as:\n\n\n1.1 Neural networks. AI classifies data to make predictions and decisions in much the same way a human brain does. A neural network is a computing system made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that process data from external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The neural network requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data. Neural networks benefit greatly from the movement aspects of data lineage \u2013 because connecting those dots directs its search for meaning.\n\n1.2 Natural language processing. AI that enables interaction, understanding and communication between humans and machines by analyzing and generating human language, including speech, is called natural language processing (NLP). NLP allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks. Natural language processing relies heavily on the human language data descriptions provided by the characteristics aspect of data lineage.\n\n1.3 Machine learning. AI that\u2019s focused on giving machines access to data and letting them learn for themselves is known as machine learning. Machine learning automates analytical model building using methods from neural networks, statistics, operations research and physics \u2013 and it finds hidden insights in data without being explicitly programmed where to look or what to conclude. Machine learning delves into the relationships, processes and transformations aspects of data lineage during its undirected exploration of data\u2019s potential.\n\n1.4 Deep learning. With deep learning, AI uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data and perform humanlike tasks, such as recognizing speech or understanding images and videos (also known as computer vision). This method takes advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques. Deep learning depends on the users\u2019 aspect of data lineage because its education is guided by analyzing how users interact with data.\n\n2 Solving the Mysteries of Data Science\u2019s Past and Present with Data Lineage: Data lineage is an essential aspect of data science and data analytics that enables organizations to understand the journey of data from its origin to its destination. It is a process of tracking the origin, movement, and transformation of data through various stages of its lifecycle. Data lineage plays a critical role in enhancing the performance and productivity of data science and analytics teams.\n\n2.1  By establishing a clear data lineage, data scientists and analysts can easily identify the source of data, its quality, and its dependencies. This information is crucial in ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and consistency. Additionally, data lineage helps teams quickly identify errors or issues in the data processing pipeline, enabling them to take corrective action promptly.\nMoreover, data lineage promotes better collaboration among team members by providing a shared understanding of the data ecosystem. This shared understanding ensures that everyone involved in the data analysis process is on the same page, reducing confusion and errors caused by miscommunication.\n\n2.2  Enterprise DataHub & Data Collaboration: Depending on your operating scale, you may even be managing multiple team members, who may be spread across different locations. JiaoZiFS enable Collaborative Datasets Version Management at Scale,Share & collaborate easily: Instantly share insights and co-edit with your team.\n\n3 DataOps & Data Products & Data Mesh: Augmenting Enterprise Data Development and Operations,JiaoZiFS ensures Responsible DataOps/AIOps/MLOps by improving Data Versioning, Provenance, and Reproducibility. JiaoziFS makes a fusion of data science and product development and allows data to be containerized into shareable, tradeable, and trackable assets(data products or data NFTs). Versioning data products in a maturing Data Mesh environment via standard processes, data consumers can be informed about both breaking and non-breaking changes in a data product, as well as retirement of data products.\n\n4 Industrial Digital Twin: Developing digital twins for manufacturing involves managing tons of large files and multiple iterations of a project. All of the data collected and created in the digital twin process (and there is a lot of it) needs to be managed carefully. JiaoziFS allows you to manage changes to files over time and store these modifications in a database.\n\n5 Data Lake Management: Data lakes are dynamic. New files and new versions of ex- isting files enter the lake at the ingestion stage. Additionally, extractors can evolve over time and generate new versions of raw data. As a result, data lake versioning is a cross-cutting concern across all stages of a data lake. Of course vanilla distributed file systems are not adequate for versioning-related operations. For example, simply storing all versions may be too costly for large datasets, and without a good version manager, just using filenames to track versions can be error-prone. In a data lake, for which there are usually many users, it is even more important to clearly maintain correct versions being used and evolving across different users. Furthermore, as the number of versions increases, efficiently and cost-effectively providing storage and retrieval of versions is going to be an important feature of a successful data lake system.",

It's the most preferred way for developers to build on filecoin and filecoin virtual machine. With IPFS content addressing, Lighthouse ensures data immutability while leveraging proof of space-time via the filecoin network to ensure continuous data storage.\n\nLighthouse ensures renewal, replication, and repair of data stored on the Filecoin network, which otherwise would have required manual configuration, ensuring data is stored long-term with strong guarantees and reliability. A unique proof provided by Lighthouse called PoDSI (proof of data segment inclusion) is a verifiable proof ensuring users' data is bundled and stored on Filecoin miners, which previously required centralized trust with other web3 storage systems.\n",

This may include data tokens, data shares, or other digital assets that represent ownership or access rights to data within the DAO.\n\nIssuance: The protocol defines the rules for issuing new assets to members of the DAO. This may involve a token sale, airdrop, or other distribution methods, and will include guidelines for determining the quantity and distribution of new assets.\n\nGovernance: The protocol establishes the governance structure for managing and making decisions about the assets within the Data DAO. This may include voting mechanisms, decision-making processes, and rules for modifying or updating the protocol itself.\n\nCompliance: The protocol ensures that all asset creation, issuance, and governance activities are compliant with relevant regulations and best practices. This may involve legal review, compliance checks, and ongoing monitoring of asset activities.\n\nTransparency: The protocol requires that all asset creation, issuance, and governance activities are transparent and accessible to all members of the Data DAO. This may include public records, open meetings, and regular reporting on asset activities.\n\nOverall, the Asset Creation, Issuance, and Governance Protocol for Data DAO is designed to ensure that the creation and management of assets within the DAO are fair, transparent, and compliant with relevant regulations. By following these rules and procedures, the Data DAO can effectively manage and govern its assets to achieve its goals of data management and governance.",

      "contributionDescription": "The concept of the Data DAO Protocol, as described, involves tokenizing social interactions related to data supply and consumption within the framework of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This approach integrates the principles of decentralized governance, tokenization, and social interactions to create a framework for managing data assets within a DAO. Here are some key aspects and potential implications of this concept:\n\n1. Tokenized Social Interactions: By tokenizing social interactions, the Data DAO Protocol can create a system where participants are incentivized and rewarded for contributing, supplying, consuming, or interacting with data within the DAO ecosystem. Tokens can be used to represent ownership, access rights, or contributions to the data assets, and can serve as a means of incentivizing and aligning the interests of participants.\n\n2. Data Supply and Consumption Interactions: The protocol can facilitate the exchange and utilization of data assets within the DAO, enabling participants to supply, consume, and interact with data in a tokenized and incentivized manner. This can include mechanisms for data sharing, data access, data analysis, and other forms of data-related interactions within the DAO ecosystem.\n\n3. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): By operating within the context of a DAO, the protocol leverages decentralized governance mechanisms to manage and govern data-related activities. This can involve decentralized decision-making, voting mechanisms, and community-driven governance processes for managing data assets, protocols, and incentives within the DAO.\n\n4. Incentivizing Data Contributions and Quality: Tokenized social interactions can be used to incentivize high-quality data contributions, data curation, and data-related activities within the DAO. By aligning incentives with the quality and value of data assets, the protocol can encourage participants to contribute and maintain high-quality data resources within the ecosystem.\n\n5. Community-Driven Data Governance: The protocol can enable community-driven governance of data assets, allowing participants to collectively determine the rules, protocols, and incentives governing data supply, consumption, and interactions. This can foster a sense of ownership and participation among DAO members and align the governance processes with the interests of the community.\n\nOverall, the Data DAO Protocol's approach to tokenized social interactions for data supply and consumption interactions within a DAO represents a novel way of managing and incentivizing data-related activities. By integrating tokenization, social interactions, and decentralized governance, the protocol aims to create a framework for sustainable and community-driven management of data assets within a decentralized ecosystem.\n",

A particular challenge in the Filecoin ecosystem is the sheer volume of information to make sense of: apart from blockchain level data, Filecoin also generates information at token, application and service levels. This information is needed by a wide variety of stakeholders, including storage providers, data clients, as well as developers at Protocol Labs and the Filecoin foundation. Since Filecoin is decentralised and collectively governed, a rigorous and holistic grasp of network health and dynamics is urgently required. \n\nStarboard\u2019s Network Health Dashboard provides the Filecoin ecosystem with a series of digestible, rigorous and informative breakdowns of the Filecoin protocol at the chain, token and service levels. We crunch and aggregate data from granular level up to distill insights into the health and state of the Filecoin network, aiding informed decision-making in the Filecoin ecosystem. \n",

      "contributionDescription": "Storage providers need to rigorously calculate initial and ongoing costs and/or ROI of onboarding storage on the network. Blockchain analytics and teams such as the Filecoin TLDR team would like to disseminate digestible and yet accurate metrics to the general public. Product and business development teams in Protocol Labs or Filecoin Foundation have an urgent need to monitor uptake of new network initiatives (e.g. FVM), consequences of network upgrades, etc. Finally, multiple stakeholders involved in the collective governance of Filecoin need access to rigorous information about the network\u2019s trajectory over time in order to make informed decisions about the future directions of the protocol.\n\nAll of these needs have a common pain point: each stakeholder depends on the availability of distilled information that is either difficult to access or non-trivial to calculate. Starboard addresses these issues by calculating metrics important to our stakeholders from first principles, for example, calculating network storage metrics from a sector-by-sector level upward. \n",
      "impactDescription": "Starboard\u2019s Network Health Dashboard has contributed significantly to the Filecoin ecosystem. \n\nA source of truth for the general public. Analytics teams such as Messari, Filecoin TLDR team, as well as Filecoin\u2019s social media accounts rely on Starboard\u2019s metrics to provide digestible insights and primers into the Filecoin ecosystem. The reach of information provided by Starboard is considerable, as it is propagated widely by our stakeholders on social media, on research/investor reports, and at international conferences. \n\nMonitoring of network initiatives. Starboard\u2019s Network Health Dashboard is continually updated to give users up-to-date information about new initiatives in the network. Our new Filecoin Virtual Machine section gives users a precise picture of adoption of smart contract use and uptake. Our dashboards are also scrutinised by product and engineering leaders in Protocol Labs for continuous monitoring, for example, to compare how specific costs and gas usage evolve before and after network upgrades. \n\nNetwork governance. In Filecoin, different stakeholders jointly participate in network governance. These parties rely on Starboard\u2019s metrics to inform their decision-making, as can be seen in the ubiquitous appearance of Starboard\u2019s statistics, charts and metrics in FIP discussions, Slack chats and more. \n",

The deployment allows users to create pools, seed concentrated liquidity, and seamlessly trade tokens through Uniswap v3's secure and efficient contracts.\n\nIntegrating the deployment into the Oku interface allows Filecoin users to create market and limit orders, deploy and backtest liquidity positions, and create new pools on an easy-to-use\u00a0frontend\u00a0with professional tools. Oku Analytics, the Uniswap v3 research platform, allows users to explore all activity on Filecoin's Uniswap v3 deployment.\u00a0This\u00a0includes a protocol summary, token, position, pool, and user analytics, all specific to the Filecoin deployment.",
      "impactDescription": "Before the official public release in March 2024, the Uniswap v3 deployment was live for five months, collecting liquidity and facilitating volume for Filecoin users.\n\nSince the formal launch in March, the deployment has demonstrated substantial impact within the Filecoin ecosystem. Notably, it reached a peak liquidity of $8.50 million, facilitating a monthly trading volume of $3.39 million, and generating $10,000 in fees. These metrics serve as tangible evidence of the deployment's efficacy in fostering liquidity provision and facilitating trading activities within the Filecoin ecosystem.\n\nThe significance of these metrics lies in their reflection of the deployment's ability to enhance market efficiency and accessibility for FVM participants. The substantial liquidity and trading volume indicate a vibrant marketplace, providing opportunities for users to exchange assets seamlessly. \n\nThese metrics are verifiable through the attached data sources, providing badgeholders with transparent insights into the deployment's performance and impact.",

      "impactDescription": "Optimistic Provide allows for low resource, sub-second DHT PUT operations. The technique is already in production and can be used by Filecoin SPs. The protocol improvement has been merged into the go-libp2p-kad-dht code-base which Lotus depends on.\n\nThe paper that the team has written has specifically measured the DHT performance of the Filecoin network (see pages 7, 8, and 9). In December 2023, the paper was accepted at the prestigious IEEE INFOCOM conference exposing the wider academic community to the Filecoin network. It is worth noting that IEEE INFOCOM is one of the top conferences in networking research with acceptance rates below 20%.",

The historic state of these data streams are useful for comparative analysis and understanding of the dynamics of the network, and deserve to both be preserved, and made available.\n\nThe Pando sidechain metadata service takes these streams of data, aggregates them into CAR archives, backs them up to filecoin, and provides a lightweight query interface for consumers to read specific points of metadata with higher assurance of their global consistency and veracity.\n",

For instance, reports of miner behavior can be used by reputation systems ranking miners, which then are used by clients to select higher quality miners near them. This data doesn\u2019t make sense to directly embed within the filecoin chain for a few reasons: It is produced by independent entities, so the data itself does not need to meet the same \u2018consensus\u2019 bar as what we would expect in a global chain, and likewise aspects of reputation and measurements may have aspects of subjectivity. It is also expected that there is diversity of data and that experimentation is a good thing.\n\nHowever, there are nice properties of having this sort of metadata ecosystem more tightly linked to the chain that seem desirable to encourage, and this leads to the goals for the sidechain metadata service:\n1. Keep included metadata consistently available\n2. Provide light-weight, unbiased access to metadata\n3. Discourage historical revisionism.\n",

ProbeLab has built and has been maintaining performance measurement tools for cid.contact, which have become the reference point for developers and users of the indexer. The results can be found here:\u00a0https://probelab.io/ipni/cid.contact/. We have been measuring lookup performance for both cached and uncached content from seven (7) different locations, performance comparisons between cached and uncached retrievals, as well as between IPNI and the IPFS Amino DHT. We are also providing detailed description of our methodology.\n\n- **Filecoin Bootstrapper monitoring:** We have built tooling to monitor the performance of the Filecoin network bootstrappers:\u00a0https://probelab.io/bootstrappers/filecoin. The tool has become the reference point for the Filecoin infrastructure team in order to monitor, debug and improve the performance of this critical piece of infrastructure for the network.\n\n- **Nebula Crawler:** The crawler that the team has created has become the defacto standard for libp2p-based networks. Notably, we extended the tool to support crawling and monitoring the Filecoin network. The data allows easy generation of measurement reports, such as this one:\u00a0https://github.com/probe-lab/network-measurements/blob/master/reports/2021/calendar-week-43/filecoin/README.md\n\n- **General IPFS metrics:** The bridging of Filecoin to IPFS for data retrieval has brought the performance of the IPFS network to the forefront of attention.

This can be done both via grants and by hiring some of the best researchers full time.\n\n**Aligning researchers**\nThe best way to scale a research team is to align the research community on our problems.\n\nIt can be hard for researchers to understand how a generic solution can have an impact on a specific problem in Filecoin; translating Filecoin specific needs in problem definitions that can be attractive to the research community can help us engage with a larger audience.\n\nWe have seen this several times in Filecoin: the need for faster SNARKs and our original RFC led to the design of Plonk (one of the most used SNARK alongside Groth16, STARKs and Halo), several teams writing improvements on PoRep (Leo\u2019s latest paper, Ari Juel\u2019s proof of incompressable proof) and our vector commitments are leading to major improvements in SNARKs (Lasso, CQ).\n\nMore importantly, we have seen that funding focused research teams (even with small grants) has led to very meaningful collaborations (e.g. work on tighter bounds of the existing PoRep).",

Spark aims to solve this. It samples the list of such CIDs, looks them up in IPNI and then makes retrieval requests to those files and reports on the results.\n\nTo make sure that Storage Providers are unaware of which clients are making Spark retrievals, Spark uses the Station network of globally distributed devices to act as the clients.\n\nBetween October 2023 and March 2024, the number of (Station) nodes running Spark requests went from essentially 0 to ranging between 10k and 20k daily. Spark is now making around 20m retrieval requests a day to Filecoin Storage Providers and it is requesting roughly half a million different file CIDs each week.\n\nIn March, the Spark protocol added the ability to calculate retrieval success rate by Storage Provider, by linking up keys in IPNI and in on-chain records. This means that the Spark Protocol can now understand the retrieval performance of each Storage Provider at a file retrieval level.\n\nN.B. Spark is making file CID retrievals not piece CID retrievals.\n",

      "contributionDescription": "Prior Art: Previous Filecoin retrieval bots retrieved pieces from Storage Provider by their Piece CID. These requests were made from a set of Protocol Labs controlled servers. \n\nSpark improves on this in the following ways.\n\n- Spark is the first retrieval protocol that samples and measures payload (or file) CID retrievals instead of piece CIDs. This matches what future hot retrieval traffic will look like.\n\n- Spark, leveraging the Station Network, uses a decentralised network of clients to make the requests and rewards them in FIL. This means that Storage Providers are much less able to distinguish between real traffic and sample traffic and so must provide a good service to both. This also keeps the infra costs in the Filecoin ecosystem rather than going to cloud giants.\n\n- Spark uses FVM for managing the payouts to Station Operators running the Spark client. \n",

The visibility into this can now help us improve the Filecoin Retrieval Success Rate.\n",

      "bio": "The Scientific Coordination Infrastructure and Operating Systems Collaborative (SciOS) works to erase gaps between and within the academic, technologist, innovator, and funding communities, with an emphasis on those contributing to open science and open-source. We co-locate these networks, map the shared problems hindering their progress, and facilitate collaborative processes to discover and catalyze the development and adoption of technological solutions. We envision a scientific process that leverages technology to measurably stabilize, enhance, and democratize the supply chain of science, making the system itself more efficient, open, and accessible.\n\nThrough physical and virtual workshops, network and community building initiatives, and directed ecosystem support and engagement, SciOS creates a Collaborative environment that connects academics, researchers, technologists, innovators, funders, policy makers, institutions, corporations, and the public with one another as well as with their peers. We leverage these connections to identify, support, accelerate, and lead the adoption of collaborative technological solutions that streamline the research process and foster open science practices driven by open-source software.\n\nThe inaugural series of SciOS workshops, SciOS24, addressed issues in critical infrastructure of science, including data storage and compute, FAIR data practices, identity management, funding and incentive design, and AI integration. These workshops brought together leading technicians and engineers in both open science and web3, fostering collaboration and innovation to tackle the challenges facing scientific infrastructure today.\n\nSciOS24 set the stage for ongoing events and programs aimed at establishing a technology-based scientific infrastructure where open science is the default mode of knowledge discovery and translation. Notably, the event, enabled by Protocol Labs, DeSci Labs, Gridcoin, and The AI Alliance exposed over 200 legacy organizations, corporations, institutions, and open source projects to technical solutions for the problems plaguing scientific infrastructure. These solutions include those within the Filecoin ecosystem.\n\nFor example, the open state data networks track brought together ecosystem partners such as DeSci Labs, Naptha AI, and IPFS with leading external technicians such as Ceramic, Orbis DB, and the GoFAIR foundation to explore how technical solutions can be woven into the future fabric of the infrastructure for scientific progress.\n\nUltimately, SciOS24 benefited track and workshop leads along with participants by providing a space to work together on shared solutions to deep tech problems. \n\nSciOS\u2019s enduring vision is to connect web3 technologies to the existing open-source and open science ecosystems. \n\nSciOS directly impacts the Filecoin and broader Web3 ecosystem through collective efforts to enhance infrastructure resilience and interoperability, broaden community breadth and engagement, and establish technical collaborations with projects outside of Web3 bubble. \n\n---\n\n# SciOS24 Outputs\n\n- 700+ registered attendees\n\n- 200+ legacy organizations, corporations, institutions, and open source projects exposed to web3 technology and ecosystem:\n\n   - https://www.go-fair.org/\n\n   - https://thealliance.ai/members\n\n   - https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects\n\n   - https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects/affiliated-projects\n\n- Juan Benet\u2019s Open Problems Workshop: This session addressed systemic challenges within decentralized science.

By learning from standardization efforts in other sectors and identifying specific needs within DeSci, the session underscored the role of Web3 and related technologies in establishing a standardized, decentralized infrastructure for scientific data. The emphasis on interoperability and collaboration across networks serves as a testament to the potential for Filecoin\u2019s ecosystem to underpin the next generation of scientific research infrastructure. \n   - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T_a8r0m53bFEiot_Ilzi0BQmlHKLUYwQQZs8lsHibfg/edit\n\n- Coordination.network\u2019s post produced interactive workshops: In collaboration with coordination.network, the SciOS workshops will be embedded into an LLM that will allow future \u201cattendees\u201d to interact with the workshops as though they were in the room at the time of the workshop.\n\n- Expansion of [The Map of Open Source Science](https://opensource.science) (MOSS): MOSS is a NumFOCUS product that maps the digital knowledge and research ecosystems. SciOS saw the addition of the AI domain to the map, which includes Filecoin and ecosystem infrastructure projects.\n\n- Hyperboard: A hyperboard is being assembled to track contributions to SciOS24 and future events. An early version from the event is shared below.\n\n- Media: Videos, audio, and images are in post-production and will be released in the coming weeks.\n\n---\n\n# SciOS Schedule and Participating Projects\n\n**Day One: Applications, Outputs, and Community Showcase**\n\n- Track Lead: SciOS Team and the DeSci Community\n\n**Day Two: Open Problems Sessions and Workshops**\n- Open Problems Sessions\n   - Track Lead: Juan Benet\n\n- Science Primitives\n   - Track Lead: Michael Zargham\n\n- DID and Permissions Workshops\n   - Track Lead: Shady el Damaty, Holonym\n      - Participants:\n         - Ceramic\n         - Orbis\n         - Holonym\n\n**Day Three: Funding, Incentives, and Open State Data Networks**\n\n- Funding and Incentive Design Workshops\n   - Track Lead: Andrew Dickson, Drips\n      - Participants:\n         - Coordination.network\n         - Open Source Observer\n         - Gridcoin\n         - Molecule\n\n- Open State Data Networks Workshops\n   - Track Lead: Will Scott\n      - Participants:\n         - DeSci Labs\n         - Ceramic\n         - Orbis\n         - Ethereum Attestation Service\n         - Intuition.Systems\n         - IPFS\n         - Protocol Labs\n\n**Day Four: FAIR Data, Semantic Publishing, and AI in Open Science**\n\n- FAIR data and Semantic Publishing Workshops\n   - Track Leads: Erik Schultes, GoFAIR foundation; Erik Van Winkle, DeSci Labs; Ronen Tamari, Common Sensemakers\n\n- AI in Open Science Workshops\n   - Track Leads: Don Gossen, Nevermined; Levi Rybalov, CoopHive\n      - Participants:\n         - Index Network\n         - Naptha AI\n         - coordination.network\n         - Common Sensemakers\n         - Block.Science\n         - Valory\n\n- Mapping the Ecosystem and Hackathon\n   - Track Leads: Jonathan Starr, NumFOCUS; Martin, coordination.network\n\n# Use of Funds\n\nFunds will be used to support SciOS in:\n\n- The formation of a continuous interest group under the [Open Source Science Initiative](https://opensource.science) (OSSci) at [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org). OSSci is an initiative that connects the worlds of open source and open science; it bridges the divide between researchers and open source research software. The SciOS interest group (likely to be called \u201cTechnology and AI in Open Science) will be dedicated to showcasing technologies, learning about other tools/technologies in the ecosystem, and discuss technology and open science with other stakeholders deeply invested in the open science, open source, and web3 movements. Examples of technologies the group will explore include, but are not limited to, distributed storage, distributed compute, and AI. The SciOS interest group will be joining already existing interest groups in Life Sciences (chaired by Eileen Koski), Chemistry/Materials Science (chaired by Dmitry Zubarev), Climate and Sustainability (chaired by Eloisa Bentivegna), and Economics (chaired by Michael Zargham).\n\n- The expansion of the workshop event model at major web3 and open science/open source conferences and events such as SciPy, the Open Source Summit, PyData, and All Things Open. Instead of asking those who web3 technology is intended to support to leave the comfort of their own community, SciOS will go to them.\n\n- Including the Web3 ecosystem in MOSS to help visualize the existence and impact of technology, tools, dependencies, programs, initiatives, organizations, funding routes, people, and scientific datasets within the Web3 ecosystem and how these technologies connect to and support the open source and open science communities.\n\n- Continued outreach to legacy organizations, institutions, and open source projects.",

      "contributionDescription": "Our project introduces a new mechanism, the Proof of Data Segment Inclusion (PoDSI), designed to improve the transparency and accountability of data aggregation processes on the Filecoin network. The core innovation of PoDSI is its ability to generate cryptographic proofs that confirm the inclusion of individual data segments within larger aggregated deals. These proofs are verifiable independently by any third party, which significantly enhances the trustworthiness and reliability of data storage on Filecoin.\n\nThe primary contributions of our project are as follows:\n\n- Development of the PoDSI Scheme: We have developed a detailed specification and corresponding cryptographic protocol that allows data aggregators to produce a Proof of Data Segment Inclusion. This proof certifies that a client's data segment has been correctly aggregated and included in a larger on-chain deal without being altered or omitted.\n\n- Implementation of the Proving Library (go-data-segment): We created a robust library in Go that implements the PoDSI protocol. This library facilitates the generation and verification of inclusion proofs by aggregators and third parties, respectively.\n\n- Integration Assistance: Our team has actively worked with prominent storage solutions like Lighthouse and web3.storage to integrate the PoDSI functionality.\n\n- On-chain Verifier Development: In collaboration with the Lighthouse team, we assisted in implementing an on-chain verifier for PoDSI. This tool enables the automatic verification of proofs directly within the Filecoin blockchain, further securing and automating the process.\n",
      "impactDescription": "The introduction and implementation of PoDSI have substantial impacts on the Filecoin ecosystem and its users:\n\n- Enhanced Data Integrity and Trust: By enabling the verification of data inclusion without needing to trust the aggregators blindly, PoDSI fosters a higher degree of trust and security. Clients can independently verify that their data is correctly handled and stored, which is crucial for sensitive or critical information.\n\n- Economic Efficiency: PoDSI allows for the economical provable onboarding of smaller data segments that previously could not be economically stored individually on Filecoin. This capability supports a broader range of use cases and clients, particularly those dealing with small but valuable datasets.\n\n- Enablement of New Applications and Services: The verifiable aggregation mechanism opens up new possibilities for dApps that require verified data storage. It also lays the groundwork for secondary markets for data and new forms of decentralized data services.\n\n- Support for L2 Data Markets: By providing a basis for Layer 2 data markets, PoDSI enhances the usability and functionality of the Filecoin network beyond primary storage solutions. It supports the creation of more complex, programmable, and interactive data services.\n\n- Contribution to the Filecoin and FEVM Ecosystems: By making small data a \"first-class citizen\" within the Filecoin ecosystem, PoDSI greatly contributes to the overall robustness and appeal of the Filecoin network and its emerging smart contract platform, the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM).\n\nIn conclusion, our project not only strengthens the existing infrastructure of Filecoin by introducing a crucial layer of verification but also expands the network\u2019s utility and opens up new economic opportunities within the decentralized storage market.",

In a dedicated effort to connect with our local readers, we have conducted an exclusive interview with Audrey Tang, Taiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs, to discuss the nation's strategic application of IPFS in bolstering cyber resilience. This interview is not just a dialogue; it's a reflection of Taiwan's unique stance on digital innovation and security, offering our audience a closer look at their government's actions in the digital realm.\n\nGoing beyond mere explanations of IPFS technology and its applications, Blocktrend is committed to providing a hands-on experience of this groundbreaking technology. Every article we produce is not only an informative piece but also a practical demonstration, as we back up each publication on the IPFS network by matters.town and liker.land. This approach allows our readers to not just understand but also interact with the technology, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Through this method, we ensure that our content is not only educational but also immersive, offering our Taiwanese readers a direct connection to the applications and implications of IPFS in their own context.",

By providing a deep dive into the practical applications of IPFS, like Matters and the Taiwan Ministry of Digital Affairs, Blocktrend has illuminated the technology's real-world relevance and potential. Their discussions have not only educated but also inspired a broader audience to recognize the significance of decentralization in the evolving digital landscape. Through their content, partnerships, and community discussions, Blocktrend has played a pivotal role in fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of IPFS and Filecoin, contributing to a more open, resilient, and decentralized web.",
